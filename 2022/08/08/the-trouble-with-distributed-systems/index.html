<h2 id="faults-and-partial-failures">1. Faults and Partial Failures</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are <strong>writing a program on a single computer</strong>, it normally behaves in a fairly <strong>predictable</strong> way: either it works or it doesn’t. Buggy software may give the appearance that the computer is sometimes “having a bad day” (a problem that is often fixed by a reboot), but that is mostly just a consequence of badly written software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no fundamental reason why software on a single computer should be flaky: when the hardware is working correctly, the same operation always produces the
same result (it is <strong>deterministic</strong>). If there is a hardware problem (e.g., memory corruption or a loose connector), the consequence is usually a total system failure (e.g., kernel panic, “blue screen of death,” failure to start up). An individual computer with good software is usually either fully functional or entirely broken, but not something in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a deliberate choice in the design of computers: if an internal fault occurs, we prefer a computer to crash completely rather than returning a wrong result, because wrong results are difficult and confusing to deal with. Thus, computers hide the fuzzy physical reality on which they are implemented and present an idealized system model that operates with mathematical perfection. A CPU instruction always does the same thing; if you write some data to memory or disk, that data remains intact and doesn’t get randomly corrupted. This design goal of always-correct computation goes all the way back to the very first digital computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are <strong>writing software that runs on several computers</strong>, connected by a network, the situation is fundamentally different. In distributed systems, we are no longer operating in an idealized system model—we have no choice but to confront the messy reality of the physical world. And in the physical world, a remarkably wide
range of things can go wrong, as illustrated by this anecdote:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my limited experience I’ve dealt with long-lived network partitions in a single data center (DC), PDU [power distribution unit] failures, switch failures, accidental power cycles of whole racks, whole-DC backbone failures, whole-DC power failures, and a hypoglycemic driver smashing his Ford pickup truck into a DC’s HVAC [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] system. And I’m not even an ops guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a <strong>distributed system</strong>, there may well be some parts of the system that are broken in some <strong>unpredictable</strong> way, even though other parts of the system are working fine. This is known as a <strong>partial failure</strong>. The difficulty is that partial failures are <strong>nondeterministic</strong>: if you try to do anything involving multiple nodes and the network, it may sometimes work and sometimes unpredictably fail. As we shall see, you may not even know whether something succeeded or not, as the time it takes for a message to travel across a network is also nondeterministic!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This nondeterminism and possibility of partial failures is what makes distributed systems hard to work with.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="unreliable-networks">2. Unreliable Networks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>shared-nothing system</strong> is a bunch of machines connected by a network. The network is the only way those machines can communicate—we assume that each machine has its own memory and disk, and one machine cannot access another machine’s memory or disk (except by making requests to a service over the network).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The internet and most internal networks in datacenters (often Ethernet) are <strong>asynchronous packet networks</strong>. In this kind of network, one node can send a message (a packet) to another node, but the network gives no guarantees as to when it will arrive, or whether it will arrive at all. If you send a request and expect a response, many things could go wrong:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Your request may have been lost (perhaps someone unplugged a network cable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your request may be waiting in a queue and will be delivered later (perhaps the network or the recipient is overloaded).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remote node may have failed (perhaps it crashed or it was powered down).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remote node may have temporarily stopped responding (perhaps it is experiencing a long garbage collection pause), but it will start responding again later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been lost on the network (perhaps a network switch has been misconfigured).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been delayed and will be delivered later (perhaps the network or your own machine is overloaded).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sender can’t even tell whether the packet was delivered: the only option is for the recipient to send a response message, which may in turn be lost or delayed. These issues are indistinguishable in an asynchronous network: the only information you have is that you haven’t received a response yet. If you send a request to another node and don’t receive a response, it is impossible to tell why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The usual way of handling this issue is a <strong>timeout</strong>: after some time you give up waiting and assume that the response is not going to arrive. However, when a timeout occurs, you still don’t know whether the remote node got your request or not (and if the request is still queued somewhere, it may still be delivered to the recipient, even if the sender has given up on it).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Handling <strong>network faults</strong> doesn’t necessarily mean <strong>tolerating</strong> them: if your network is normally fairly reliable, a valid approach may be to simply show an error message to users while your network is experiencing problems. However, you do need to know how your software reacts to network problems and ensure that the system can recover from them. It may make sense to deliberately trigger network problems and test the system’s response (this is the idea behind <strong>Chaos Monkey</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a timeout is the only sure way of detecting a fault, then how long should the timeout be? There is unfortunately no simple answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A long timeout means a long wait until a node is declared dead (and during this time, users may have to wait or see error messages). A short timeout detects faults faster, but carries a higher risk of incorrectly declaring a node dead when in fact it has only suffered a temporary slowdown (e.g., due to a load spike on the node or the network).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have to assume that <strong>network congestion</strong>, <strong>queueing</strong>, and <strong>unbounded delays</strong> will happen. Consequently, there’s no “correct” value for timeouts—they need to be determined experimentally.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="unreliable-clocks">3. Unreliable Clocks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clocks and time are important. Applications depend on clocks in various ways to answer questions like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Has this request timed out yet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the 99th percentile response time of this service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many queries per second did this service handle on average in the last five minutes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long did the user spend on our site?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was this article published?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what date and time should the reminder email be sent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When does this cache entry expire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the timestamp on this error message in the log file?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a distributed system, time is a tricky business, because communication is not instantaneous: it takes time for a message to travel across the network from one
machine to another. The time when a message is received is always later than the time when it is sent, but due to variable delays in the network, we don’t know how
much later. This fact sometimes makes it difficult to determine the order in which things happened when multiple machines are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, each machine on the network has its own clock, which is an actual hardware device: usually a quartz crystal oscillator. These devices are not perfectly accurate, so each machine has its own notion of time, which may be slightly faster or slower than on other machines. It is possible to synchronize clocks to some degree: the most commonly used mechanism is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which allows the computer clock to be adjusted according to the time reported by a group of
servers. The servers in turn get their time from a more accurate time source, such as a GPS receiver.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="monotonic-versus-time-of-day-clocks">3.1. Monotonic Versus Time-of-Day Clocks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern computers have at least two different kinds of clocks: a <strong>time-of-day clock</strong> and a <strong>monotonic clock</strong>. Although they both measure time, it is important to distinguish the two, since they serve different purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="time-of-day-clocks">3.1.1. Time-of-day clocks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A time-of-day clock does what you intuitively expect of a clock: it returns the current date and time according to some calendar (also known as <strong>wall-clock time</strong>). For example, <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)</code> on Linuxv and <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> in Java return the number of seconds (or milliseconds) since the epoch: midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, according to the Gregorian calendar, not counting leap seconds. Some systems use other dates as their reference point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time-of-day clocks are usually synchronized with <strong>NTP</strong>, which means that a timestamp from one machine (ideally) means the same as a timestamp on another machine. However, time-of-day clocks also have various oddities. In particular, if the local clock is too far ahead of the NTP server, it may be forcibly reset and appear to <strong>jump back to a previous point in time</strong>. These jumps, as well as the fact that they often ignore leap seconds, make time-of-day clocks unsuitable for measuring elapsed time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="monotonic-clocks">3.2. Monotonic clocks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A monotonic clock is suitable for measuring a <strong>duration</strong> (time interval), such as a timeout or a service’s response time: <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> on Linux and <code>System.nanoTime()</code> in Java are monotonic clocks, for example. The name comes from the fact that they are guaranteed to always move forward (whereas a time-of-day clock may jump back in time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a server with multiple CPU sockets, there may be a separate <strong>timer per CPU</strong>, which is not necessarily synchronized with other CPUs. Operating systems compensate for any discrepancy and try to present a monotonic view of the clock to application threads, even as they are scheduled across different CPUs. However, it is wise to take this guarantee of monotonicity with a pinch of salt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NTP may adjust the frequency at which the monotonic clock moves forward (this is known as slewing the clock) if it detects that the computer’s local quartz is moving faster or slower than the NTP server. By default, <strong>NTP allows the clock rate to be speeded up or slowed down by up to 0.05%, but NTP cannot cause the monotonic clock to jump forward or backward.</strong> The resolution of monotonic clocks is usually quite good: on most systems they can measure time intervals in microseconds or less.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a distributed system, using a monotonic clock for measuring elapsed time (e.g., timeouts) is usually fine, because it doesn’t assume any synchronization between different nodes’ clocks and is not sensitive to slight inaccuracies of measurement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="process-pauses">3.2.1. Process Pauses</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many programming language runtimes (such as the Java Virtual Machine) have a garbage collector (GC) that occasionally needs to stop all running threads. These “<strong>stop-the-world</strong>” GC pauses have sometimes been known to last for several minutes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In virtualized environments, a virtual machine can be <strong>suspended</strong> (pausing the execution of all processes and saving the contents of memory to disk) and <strong>resumed</strong> (restoring the contents of memory and continuing execution). This pause can occur at any time in a process’s execution and can last for an arbitrary length of time. This feature is sometimes used for <strong>live migration of virtual machines</strong> from one host to another without a reboot, in which case the length of the pause depends on the rate at which processes are writing to memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On end-user devices such as laptops, execution may also be suspended and resumed arbitrarily, e.g., when the user closes the lid of their laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the operating system <strong>context-switches to another thread</strong>, or when the <strong>hypervisor switches to a different virtual machine</strong> (when running in a virtual machine), the currently running thread can be paused at any arbitrary point in the code. In the case of a virtual machine, the CPU time spent in other virtual machines is known as steal time. If the machine is under heavy load—i.e., if there is a long queue of threads waiting to run—it may take some time before the paused thread gets to run again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the application performs synchronous disk access, a thread may be paused waiting for a <strong>slow disk I/O operation</strong> to complete. In many languages, disk access can happen surprisingly, even if the code doesn’t explicitly mention file access—for example, the Java classloader lazily loads class files when they are first used, which could happen at any time in the program execution. I/O pauses and GC pauses may even conspire to combine their delays. If the disk is actually a network filesystem or network block device (such as Amazon’s EBS), the I/O latency is further subject to the variability of network delays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the operating system is configured to allow swapping to disk (<strong>paging</strong>), a simple memory access may result in a <strong>page fault</strong> that requires a page from disk to be loaded into memory. The thread is paused while this slow I/O operation takes place. If memory pressure is high, this may in turn require a different page to be swapped out to disk. In extreme circumstances, the operating system may spend most of its time swapping pages in and out of memory and getting little actual work done (this is known as thrashing). To avoid this problem, paging is often disabled on server machines (if you would rather kill a process to free up memory than risk thrashing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Unix process can be paused by sending it the <code>SIGSTOP</code> signal, for example by pressing Ctrl-Z in a shell. This signal immediately stops the process from getting any more CPU cycles until it is resumed with <code>SIGCONT</code>, at which point it continues running where it left off. Even if your environment does not normally use <code>SIGSTOP</code>, it might be sent accidentally by an operations engineer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="knowledge-truth-and-lies">4. Knowledge, Truth, and Lies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Distributed systems are different from programs running on a single computer: there is no shared memory, only message passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the systems may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and processing pauses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A node in the network cannot know anything for sure—it can only make guesses based on the <strong>messages</strong> it receives (or doesn’t receive) via the network. A node can only find out what state another node is in (what data it has stored, whether it is correctly functioning, etc.) by exchanging messages with it. If a remote node doesn’t respond, there is no way of knowing what state it is in, because problems in the network cannot reliably be distinguished from problems at a node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, we don’t need to go as far as figuring out the meaning of life. In a distributed system, we can state the assumptions we are making about the behavior (the <strong>system model</strong>) and design the actual system in such a way that it meets those assumptions. Algorithms can be proved to function correctly within a certain system model. This means that reliable behavior is achievable, even if the underlying system model provides very few guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="the-truth-is-defined-by-the-majority">4.1. The Truth Is Defined by the Majority</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine a network with an asymmetric fault: a node is able to receive all messages sent to it, but any outgoing messages from that node are dropped or delayed. Even though that node is working perfectly well, and is receiving requests from other nodes, the other nodes cannot hear its responses. After some timeout, the other nodes declare it dead, because they haven’t heard from the node. The situation unfolds like a nightmare: the semi-disconnected node is dragged to the graveyard, kicking and screaming “I’m not dead!”—but since nobody can hear its screaming, the funeral procession continues with stoic determination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a slightly less nightmarish scenario, the semi-disconnected node may notice that the messages it is sending are not being acknowledged by other nodes, and so realize that there must be a fault in the network. Nevertheless, the node is wrongly declared dead by the other nodes, and the semi-disconnected node cannot do anything about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a third scenario, imagine a node that experiences a long stop-the-world garbage collection pause. All of the node’s threads are preempted by the GC and paused for one minute, and consequently, no requests are processed and no responses are sent. The other nodes wait, retry, grow impatient, and eventually declare the node dead and load it onto the hearse. Finally, the GC finishes and the node’s threads continue as if nothing had happened. The other nodes are surprised as the supposedly dead node suddenly raises its head out of the coffin, in full health, and starts cheerfully chatting with bystanders. At first, the GCing node doesn’t even realize that an entire minute has passed and that it was declared dead—from its perspective, hardly any time has passed since it was last talking to the other nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The moral of these stories is that a node cannot necessarily trust its own judgment of a situation. <strong>A distributed system cannot exclusively rely on a single node, because a node may fail at any time, potentially leaving the system stuck and unable to recover</strong>. Instead, many distributed algorithms rely on a <strong>quorum</strong>, that is, voting among the nodes: decisions require some minimum number of votes from several nodes in order to reduce the dependence on any one particular node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That includes decisions about declaring nodes dead. If a quorum of nodes declares another node dead, then it must be considered dead, even if that node still very much feels alive. The individual node must abide by the quorum decision and step down. Most commonly, the quorum is an absolute majority of more than half the nodes (although other kinds of quorums are possible). A majority quorum allows the system to continue working if individual nodes have failed (with three nodes, one failure can be tolerated; with five nodes, two failures can be tolerated). However, it is still safe, because there can only be only one majority in the system—there cannot be two majorities with conflicting decisions at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="the-leader-and-the-lock">4.1.1. The leader and the lock</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequently, a system requires there to be only one of some thing. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only one node is allowed to be the leader for a database partition, to avoid split brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one transaction or client is allowed to hold the lock for a particular resource or object, to prevent concurrently writing to it and corrupting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one user is allowed to register a particular username, because a username must uniquely identify a user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementing this in a distributed system requires care: even if a node believes that it is “the chosen one” (the leader of the partition, the holder of the lock, the request handler of the user who successfully grabbed the username), that doesn’t necessarily mean a quorum of nodes agrees! A node may have formerly been the leader, but if the other nodes declared it dead in the meantime (e.g., due to a network interruption or GC pause), it may have been demoted and another leader may have already been elected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a node continues acting as the chosen one, even though the majority of nodes have declared it dead, it could cause problems in a system that is not carefully designed. Such a node could send messages to other nodes in its self-appointed capacity, and if other nodes believe it, the system as a whole may do something incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, Figure 8-4 shows a data corruption bug due to an incorrect implementation of locking. (The bug is not theoretical: HBase used to have this problem.) Say you want to ensure that a file in a storage service can only be accessed by one client at a time, because if multiple clients tried to write to it, the file would become corrupted. You try to implement this by requiring a client to obtain a lease from a <strong>lock service</strong> before accessing the file.</p>

<p>The problem is an example of process pauses: if the client holding the lease is paused for too long, its lease expires. Another client can obtain a lease for the same file, and start writing to the file. When the paused client comes back, it believes (incorrectly) that it still has a valid lease and proceeds to also write to the file. As a result, the clients’ writes clash and corrupt the file.</p>

<h4 id="fencing-tokens">4.1.2. Fencing tokens</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using a lock or lease to protect access to some resource, such as the file storage in Figure 8-4, we need to ensure that a node that is under a false belief of being “the chosen one” cannot disrupt the rest of the system. A fairly simple technique that achieves this goal is called <strong>fencing</strong>, and is illustrated in Figure 8-5.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/assets/database-transactions/Figure_8-5_fencing_tokens.png" alt="Figure 8 5 fencing tokens" width="75%" height="75%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s assume that every time the lock server grants a lock or lease, it also returns a <strong>fencing token</strong>, which is a number that increases every time a lock is granted (e.g., incremented by the lock service). We can then require that every time a client sends a write request to the storage service, it must include its current fencing token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Figure 8-5, client 1 acquires the lease with a token of 33, but then it goes into a long pause and the lease expires. Client 2 acquires the lease with a token of 34 (the number always increases) and then sends its write request to the storage service, including the token of 34. Later, client 1 comes back to life and sends its write to the storage service, including its token value 33. However, the storage server remembers that it has already processed a write with a higher token number (34), and so it rejects the request with token 33.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <strong>ZooKeeper</strong> is used as lock service, the transaction ID <code>zxid</code> or the node version cversion can be used as fencing token. Since they are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing, they have the required properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this mechanism requires the resource itself to take an active role in checking tokens by rejecting any writes with an older token than one that has already been processed—it is not sufficient to rely on clients checking their lock status themselves. For resources that do not explicitly support fencing tokens, you might still be able work around the limitation (for example, in the case of a file storage service you could include the fencing token in the filename). However, some kind of check is necessary to avoid processing requests outside of the lock’s protection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Checking a token on the server side may seem like a downside, but it is arguably a good thing: it is unwise for a service to assume that its clients will always be well behaved, because the clients are often run by people whose priorities are very different from the priorities of the people running the service. Thus, it is a good idea for any service to protect itself from accidentally abusive clients.</p>

<h3 id="byzantine-faults">4.2. Byzantine Faults</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fencing tokens can detect and block a node that is inadvertently acting in error (e.g., because it hasn’t yet found out that its lease has expired). However, if the node deliberately wanted to subvert the system’s guarantees, it could easily do so by sending messages with a fake fencing token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Distributed systems problems become much harder if there is a risk that nodes may “<strong>lie</strong>” (send arbitrary faulty or corrupted responses)—for example, if a node may claim to have received a particular message when in fact it didn’t. Such behavior is known as a <strong>Byzantine fault</strong>, and the problem of reaching <strong>consensus</strong> in this <strong>untrusting environment</strong> is known as the <strong>Byzantine Generals Problem</strong>.</p>

<div class="title">The Byzantine Generals Problem</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Byzantine Generals Problem is a generalization of the so-called Two Generals Problem, which imagines a situation in which two army generals need to agree on a battle plan. As they have set up camp on two different sites, they can only communicate by messenger, and the messengers sometimes get delayed or lost (like packets
in a network).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Byzantine version of the problem, there are n generals who need to agree, and their endeavor is hampered by the fact that there are some traitors in their midst. Most of the generals are loyal, and thus send truthful messages, but the traitors may try to deceive and confuse the others by sending fake or untrue messages (while trying to remain undiscovered). It is not known in advance who the traitors are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Byzantium was an ancient Greek city that later became Constantinople, in the place which is now Istanbul in Turkey. There isn’t any historic evidence that the generals of Byzantium were any more prone to intrigue and conspiracy than those elsewhere. Rather, the name is derived from Byzantine in the sense of excessively complicated, bureaucratic, devious, which was used in politics long before computers. Lamport wanted to choose a nationality that would not offend any readers, and he was advised that calling it The Albanian Generals Problem was not such a good idea.</p>

<p>A system is <strong>Byzantine fault-tolerant</strong> if it continues to operate correctly even if some of the nodes are malfunctioning and not obeying the protocol, or if malicious attackers are interfering with the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, we can usually safely assume that there are no Byzantine faults. In your datacenter, all the nodes are controlled by your organization (so they can hopefully be trusted) and radiation levels are low enough that memory corruption is not a major problem. Protocols for making systems Byzantine fault-tolerant are quite complicated, and fault-tolerant embedded systems rely on support from the hardware level. In most server-side data systems, the cost of deploying Byzantine fault-tolerant solutions makes them impractical.</p>

<h3 id="system-model-and-reality">4.3. System Model and Reality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With regard to timing assumptions, three system models are in common use:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchronous model</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The synchronous model assumes <strong>bounded</strong> network delay, bounded process pauses, and bounded clock error. This does not imply exactly synchronized clocks or zero network delay; it just means you know that network delay, pauses, and clock drift will never exceed some fixed upper bound. The synchronous model is not a realistic model of most practical systems, because unbounded delays and pauses do occur.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partially synchronous model</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Partial synchrony means that a system behaves like a synchronous system most of the time, but it sometimes exceeds the bounds for network delay, process pauses, and clock drift. This is a realistic model of many systems: most of the time, networks and processes are quite well behaved—otherwise we would never be able to get anything done—but we have to reckon with the fact that any timing assumptions may be shattered occasionally. When this happens, network delay, pauses, and clock error may become arbitrarily large.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asynchronous model</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this model, an algorithm is not allowed to make any timing assumptions—in fact, it does not even have a clock (so it cannot use timeouts). Some algorithms can be designed for the asynchronous model, but it is very restrictive.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, besides timing issues, we have to consider node failures. The three most common system models for nodes are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Crash-stop faults</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the crash-stop model, an algorithm may assume that a node can fail in only one way, namely by crashing. This means that the node may suddenly stop responding at any moment, and thereafter that node is gone forever—it never comes back.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crash-recovery faults</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We assume that nodes may crash at any moment, and perhaps start responding again after some unknown time. In the crash-recovery model, nodes are assumed to have stable storage (i.e., nonvolatile disk storage) that is preserved across crashes, while the in-memory state is assumed to be lost.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Byzantine (arbitrary) faults</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nodes may do absolutely anything, including trying to trick and deceive other nodes.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For modeling real systems, the <strong>partially synchronous model</strong> with <strong>crash-recovery faults</strong> is generally the most useful model. But how do distributed algorithms cope with that model?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="correctness-of-an-algorithm">4.3.1. Correctness of an algorithm</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To define what it means for an algorithm to be <strong>correct</strong>, we can describe its <strong>properties</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if we are generating <strong>fencing tokens</strong> for a lock, we may require the algorithm to have the following properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uniqueness</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No two requests for a fencing token return the same value.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monotonic sequence</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If request x returned token tx, and request y returned token ty, and x completed before y began, then tx &lt; ty.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A node that requests a fencing token and does not crash eventually receives a response.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An algorithm is correct in some system model if it always satisfies its properties in all situations that we assume may occur in that system model. But how does this make sense? If all nodes crash, or all network delays suddenly become infinitely long, then no algorithm will be able to get anything done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="safety-and-liveness">4.3.2. Safety and liveness</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To clarify the situation, it is worth distinguishing between two different kinds of properties: <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>liveness</strong> properties. In the example just given, <em>uniqueness</em> and <em>monotonic sequence</em> are safety properties, but <em>availability</em> is a liveness property.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Safety is often informally defined as nothing bad happens, and liveness as something good eventually happens.</strong> However, it’s best to not read too much into those informal definitions, because the meaning of good and bad is subjective. The actual definitions of safety and liveness are precise and mathematical:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a safety property is violated, we can point at a particular point in time at which it was broken (for example, if the uniqueness property was violated, we can identify the particular operation in which a duplicate fencing token was returned). After a safety property has been violated, the violation cannot be undone—the damage is already done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A liveness property works the other way round: it may not hold at some point in time (for example, a node may have sent a request but not yet received a response), but there is always hope that it may be satisfied in the future (namely by receiving a response).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An advantage of distinguishing between safety and liveness properties is that it helps us deal with difficult system models. For distributed algorithms, it is common to require that safety properties always hold, in all possible situations of a system model. That is, even if all nodes crash, or the entire network fails, the algorithm must nevertheless ensure that it does not return a wrong result (i.e., that the safety properties remain satisfied).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, with liveness properties we are allowed to make caveats: for example, we could say that a request needs to receive a response only if a majority of nodes have not crashed, and only if the network eventually recovers from an outage. The definition of the partially synchronous model requires that eventually the system returns to a synchronous state—that is, any period of network interruption lasts only for a finite duration and is then repaired.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="summary">5. Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we have discussed a wide range of problems that can occur in distributed systems, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whenever you try to send a packet over the <strong>network</strong>, it may be lost or arbitrarily delayed. Likewise, the reply may be lost or delayed, so if you don’t get a reply, you have no idea whether the message got through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A node’s <strong>clock</strong> may be significantly out of sync with other nodes (despite your best efforts to set up NTP), it may suddenly jump forward or back in time, and relying on it is dangerous because you most likely don’t have a good measure of your clock’s error interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>process</strong> may pause for a substantial amount of time at any point in its execution (perhaps due to a stop-the-world garbage collector), be declared dead by other nodes, and then come back to life again without realizing that it was paused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that such <strong>partial failures</strong> can occur is the defining characteristic of distributed systems. Whenever software tries to do anything involving other nodes, there is the possibility that it may occasionally fail, or randomly go slow, or not respond at all (and eventually time out). In distributed systems, we try to build tolerance of partial failures into software, so that the system as a whole may continue functioning even when some of its constituent parts are broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To <strong>tolerate faults</strong>, the first step is to <strong>detect</strong> them, but even that is hard. Most systems don’t have an accurate mechanism of detecting whether a node has failed, so most distributed algorithms rely on <strong>timeouts</strong> to determine whether a remote node is still available. However, timeouts can’t distinguish between network and node failures, and variable network delay sometimes causes a node to be falsely suspected of crashing. Moreover, sometimes a node can be in a degraded state: for example, a Gigabit network interface could suddenly drop to 1 Kb/s throughput due to a driver bug. Such a node that is “limping” but not dead can be even more difficult to deal with than a cleanly failed node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a fault is detected, making a system tolerate it is not easy either: there is no global variable, no shared memory, no common knowledge or any other kind of shared state between the machines. Nodes can’t even agree on what time it is, let alone on anything more profound. The only way information can flow from one node to another is by sending it over the unreliable network. Major decisions cannot be safely made by a single node, so we require protocols that enlist help from other nodes and try to get a quorum to agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re used to writing software in the idealized mathematical perfection of a single computer, where the same operation always deterministically returns the same result, then moving to the messy physical reality of distributed systems can be a bit of a shock. Conversely, distributed systems engineers will often regard a problem as trivial if it can be solved on a single computer, and indeed a single computer can do a lot nowadays. If you can avoid opening Pandora’s box and simply keep things on a single machine, it is generally worth doing so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, <strong>scalability</strong> is not the only reason for wanting to use a distributed system. <strong>Fault tolerance</strong> and <strong>low latency</strong> (by placing data geographically close to users) are equally important goals, and those things cannot be achieved with a single node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we also went on some tangents to explore whether the unreliability of networks, clocks, and processes is an inevitable law of nature. We saw that it isn’t: it is possible to give hard real-time response guarantees and bounded delays in networks, but doing so is very expensive and results in lower utilization of hardware resources. Most non-safety-critical systems choose cheap and unreliable over expensive and reliable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also touched on supercomputers, which assume reliable components and thus have to be stopped and restarted entirely when a component does fail. By contrast, distributed systems can run forever without being interrupted at the service level, because all faults and maintenance can be handled at the node level—at least in theory. (In practice, if a bad configuration change is rolled out to all nodes, that will still bring a distributed system to its knees.)</p>
