<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>computer network</strong> is a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computers</a> sharing resources located on or provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">network nodes</a>. The computers use common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocols</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal">digital</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnection">interconnections</a> to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication_network">telecommunication network</a> technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">network topologies</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nodes of a computer network may include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">personal computers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware">networking hardware</a>, or other specialised or general-purpose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)">hosts</a>. They are identified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address">network addresses</a>, and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium">transmission medium</a> used to carry signals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)">bandwidth</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol">communications protocols</a> to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control">traffic control</a> mechanism, and organizational intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer networks support many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">applications</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service">services</a>, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server">application and storage servers</a>, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="network-packet">1.1. Network Packet</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">network packet</a> is a formatted unit of data carried by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network">packet-switched network</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address">network addresses</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection">error detection</a> codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing)">packet headers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(computing)">trailers</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)">payload data</a> in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With packets, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)">bandwidth</a> of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuit switched</a>. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn&#8217;t overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">queued</a> and waits until a link is free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit">maximum transmission unit</a> (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Terminology</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the seven-layer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a> of computer networking, <code>packet</code> strictly refers to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit">protocol data unit</a> at layer 3, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">network layer</a>. A data unit at layer 2, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">data link layer</a>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking)"><code>frame</code></a>. In layer 4, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">transport layer</a>, the data units are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_segment"><code>segments</code></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram"><code>datagrams</code></a>. Thus, in the example of TCP/IP communication over Ethernet, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_segment">TCP segment</a> is carried in one or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_packet_(disambiguation)">IP packets</a>, which are each carried in one or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a>.</p>

<h3 id="network-topology">1.2. Network Topology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">Network topology</a> is the layout, pattern, or organizational hierarchy of the interconnection of network hosts, in contrast to their physical or geographic location. Typically, most diagrams describing networks are arranged by their topology. The network topology can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.</p>

<img src="/assets/computer-network/NetworkTopologies.svg" alt="NetworkTopologies">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Common network topologies</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common layouts are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network">Bus network</a>: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5">10BASE5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2">10BASE2</a>. This is still a common topology on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">data link layer</a>, although modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer">physical layer</a> variants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)">point-to-point</a> links instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network">Star network</a>: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN">Wireless LAN</a>, where each wireless client connects to the central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">Wireless access point</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network">Ring network</a>: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface">Fiber Distributed Data Interface</a> (FDDI) made use of such a topology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_network">Mesh network</a>: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_connected_network">Fully connected network</a>: each node is connected to every other node in the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network">Tree network</a>: nodes are arranged hierarchically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface">FDDI</a>, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.</p>

<h3 id="overlay-network">1.3. Overlay network</h3>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/assets/computer-network/Network_Overlay_merged.svg" alt="75%" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. A sample overlay network</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a> is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem">modems</a>, before any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network#Data_network">data network</a> existed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_network">telephone network</a>. Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">Address resolution</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">routing</a> are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example of an overlay network is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a>, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">map</a>) indexed by keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality of service</a> guarantees achieve higher-quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media">streaming media</a>. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multicast">IP Multicast</a> have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">routers</a> in the network. On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">Internet service providers</a>. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies">Akamai Technologies</a> manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast</a>, resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="network-links">1.4. Network Links</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium">physical medium</a>) used to link devices to form a computer network include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_cable">electrical cable</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber">optical fiber</a>, and free space. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a>, the software to handle the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A widely adopted family that uses copper and fiber media in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">local area network</a> (LAN) technology are collectively known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3">IEEE 802.3</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN">Wireless LAN</a> standards use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves">radio waves</a>, others use infrared signals as a transmission medium. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication">Power line communication</a> uses a building&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_cabling">power cabling</a> to transmit data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="wired">1.4.1. Wired</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable">Coaxial cable</a> is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T">ITU-T</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn">G.hn</a> technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair">Twisted pair</a> cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics)">crosstalk</a> and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber">optical fiber</a> is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_amplifier">optical amplifiers</a>. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing">wave division multiplexing</a>, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersea_cables">undersea cables</a> to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_optical_fiber">single-mode optical fiber</a> (SMF) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber">multi-mode optical fiber</a> (MMF). Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.</p>

<h4 id="wireless">1.4.2. Wireless</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Terrestrial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave">microwave</a> – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles (64 km) apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite">Communications satellites</a> – Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network">Cellular networks</a> use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication">Free-space optical communication</a> uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.</p>

<h3 id="network-nodes">1.5. Network Nodes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">system</a> building blocks, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller">network interface controllers</a> (NICs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater">repeaters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub">hubs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge">bridges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">switches</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">routers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem">modems</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewalls</a>. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="network-interfaces">1.5.1. Network interfaces</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller">network interface controller</a> (NIC) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware">computer hardware</a> that connects the computer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_media">network media</a> and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> networks, each network interface controller has a unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">Media Access Control</a> (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller&#8217;s permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="repeaters-and-hubs">1.5.2. Repeaters and hubs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater">repeater</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics">electronic</a> device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmitted</a> at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay">propagation delay</a> that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-4-3_rule">5-4-3 rule</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub">Ethernet hub</a>.</strong> In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">network switches</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="bridges-and-switches">1.5.3. Bridges and switches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge">Network bridges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">network switches</a> are distinct from a hub in that they only forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports. <strong>Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.</strong> Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bridges and switches operate at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">data link layer</a> (layer 2) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge">bridge</a> traffic between two or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment">network segments</a> to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking)">frames</a> of data between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(hardware)">ports</a> based on the destination MAC address in each frame. They learn the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source, and discovers the location from the reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bridges and switches divide the network&#8217;s collision domain but maintain a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a> is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication">connection-oriented</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication">connectionless</a>, they may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_mode">circuit mode</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet switching</a>, and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.</p>

<h5 id="internet-protocol-suite">Internet Protocol Suite</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite">Internet Protocol Suite</a>, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less and connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol (IP). At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">Internet Protocol Version 4</a> (IPv4) and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet Protocol Suite is the defining set of protocols for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.</p>

<h5 id="ieee-802">IEEE 802</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802">IEEE 802</a> is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)">MAC bridging</a> (IEEE 802.1D) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol">Spanning Tree Protocol</a>. IEEE 802.1Q describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>, and IEEE 802.1X  defines a port-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Control">Network Access Control</a> protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a "wireless access key".</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="sonetsdh">SONET/SDH</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_optical_networking">Synchronous optical networking</a> (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing">multiplexing</a> protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuit-switched</a> voice encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCM">PCM</a> (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode">Asynchronous Transfer Mode</a> (ATM) frames.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="asynchronous-transfer-mode">Asynchronous Transfer Mode</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode">Asynchronous Transfer Mode</a> (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing">time-division multiplexing</a> and encodes data into small, fixed-sized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_relay">cells</a>. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet Protocol Suite or Ethernet that use variable sized packets or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_Relay">frames</a>. ATM has similarities with both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet</a> switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)">low-latency</a> content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_circuit">virtual circuit</a> must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_generation_network">next-generation networks</a>, it still plays a role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">last mile</a>, which is the connection between an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">Internet service provider</a> and the home user.</p>

<h4 id="routing">1.6.2. Routing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">Routing</a> is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuit switching</a> networks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet switched networks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In packet-switched networks, routing protocols direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_forwarding">packet forwarding</a> (the transit of logically addressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">network packets</a> from their source toward their ultimate destination) through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">routers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)">bridges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)">gateways</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewalls</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">switches</a>. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from the limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router&#8217;s memory, is very important for efficient routing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prefix-Length: where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over a different routing protocol)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metric: where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_distance">Administrative distance</a>: where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_routing">Multipath routing</a> techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Routing, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.</p>

Each computer or device on the network is a node. Wired LANs are most likely based on Ethernet technology. Newer standards such as ITU-T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network">wide area network</a> (WAN), include higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)">data transfer rates</a>, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line">leased lines</a> to provide connectivity.

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network">storage area network</a> (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world.

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private network</a> (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VPN may have best-effort performance or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_delay">Network delay</a> is a design and performance characteristic of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">telecommunications network</a>. It specifies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)">latency</a> for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. It is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second. Delay may differ slightly, depending on the location of the specific pair of communicating endpoints. Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_delay">Processing delay</a> – time it takes a router to process the packet header</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of packet-switched network, viz. ATM:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Circuit-switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_of_service">grade of service</a>. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique, and modem enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled instead of measured. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram">state transition diagrams</a> are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="network-congestion">1.10.4. Network congestion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion">Network congestion</a> occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality of service</a>. When networks are congested and queues become too full, packets have to be discarded, and so networks rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">re-transmission</a>. Typical effects of congestion include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queueing_delay">queueing delay</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss">packet loss</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_probability">blocking</a> of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offered_load">offered load</a> lead either to only a small increase in the network throughput or to a reduction in network throughput.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Network protocols that use aggressive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmissions</a> to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion—even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as <em>congestive collapse</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern networks use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_control">congestion control</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_avoidance">congestion avoidance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_control">traffic control</a> techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse (i.e. endpoints typically slow down or sometimes even stop transmission entirely when the network is congested). These techniques include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a> in protocols such as 802.11&#8217;s CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window">window</a> reduction in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_protocol">TCP</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_queueing">fair queueing</a> in devices such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">routers</a>. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is 802.1p. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">Local area networking</a> over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).</p>

It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, many civil rights and privacy groups—such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union—have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT&amp;T.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">End-to-end encryption</a> (E2EE) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">digital communications</a> paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encrypting</a> data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_providers">Internet providers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider">application service providers</a>, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality">confidentiality</a> and

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of end-to-end encryption include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> for web traffic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> for email, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR</a> for instant messaging, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP">ZRTP</a> for telephony, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Trunked_Radio">TETRA</a> for radio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox. Some such systems, for example, LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering "end-to-end" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)">back door</a> that subverts negotiation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_key">encryption key</a> between the communicating parties, for example Skype or Hushmail.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the endpoints of the communication themselves, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)">technical exploitation</a> of clients, poor quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator">random number generators</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow">key escrow</a>.

<h4 id="ssltls">1.11.4. SSL/TLS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.</p>

From lowest to highest, the layers are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer"><strong>link layer</strong></a>, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer"><strong>internet layer</strong></a>, providing internetworking between independent networks; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer"><strong>transport layer</strong></a>, handling host-to-host communication; and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer"><strong>application layer</strong></a>, providing <strong>process-to-process</strong> data exchange for applications.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 6. Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (A and B) connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protocols of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">link layer</a> operate within the scope of the local network connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the link in TCP/IP parlance and is the lowest component layer of the suite. <strong>The link includes all hosts accessible without traversing a router</strong>. The size of the link is therefore determined by the networking hardware design. In principle, TCP/IP is designed to be <strong>hardware independent</strong> and may be implemented on top of virtually any link-layer technology. This includes not only hardware implementations, but also virtual link layers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol">networking tunnels</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The link layer is used to move packets between the Internet layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on the link can be controlled in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver">device driver</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card">network card</a>, as well as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware">firmware</a> or by specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipsets">chipsets</a>. These perform functions, such as framing, to prepare the Internet layer packets for transmission, and finally transmit the frames to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer">physical layer</a> and over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium">transmission medium</a>. The TCP/IP model includes specifications for translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link-layer addresses, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_access_control">media access control</a> (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist, and are not explicitly defined in the TCP/IP model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The link layer in the TCP/IP model has corresponding functions in Layer 2 of the OSI model.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="internet-layer">2.2. Internet layer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking">Internetworking</a> requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing">routing</a> and is supported by host addressing and identification using the hierarchical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addressing</a> system. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer">internet layer</a> provides an unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. The internet layer has the responsibility of sending packets across potentially multiple networks. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The internet layer does not distinguish between the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data for a variety of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_layer_protocol">upper layer protocols</a>. These protocols are each identified by a unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers">protocol number</a>: for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">Internet Control Message Protocol</a> (ICMP) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol">Internet Group Management Protocol</a> (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.</p>

<p>The Internet Protocol is the principal component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">Internet Protocol version 4</a> (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">Internet Protocol version 6</a> (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IPv4 address space was originally divided into five classes. Classes A, B, and C were used for assigning addresses to interfaces on hte Internet (unicast addresses) and for some other special-use. The classes are defined by the first bits in the address: 0 for class A, 10 for class B, 110 for class C, and so on. Class D addresses are for multicast use, and class E addresses remain reserved.</p>

<h3 id="transport-layer">2.3. Transport layer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">transport layer</a> establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes host-to-host connectivity in the form of end-to-end message transfer services that are independent of the underlying network and independent of the structure of user data and the logistics of exchanging information. Connectivity at the transport layer can be categorized as either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented">connection-oriented</a>, implemented in TCP, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless">connectionless</a>, implemented in UDP. The protocols in this layer may provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">error control</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segmentation">segmentation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)">flow control</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion">congestion control</a>, and application addressing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port numbers</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purpose of providing process-specific transmission channels for applications, the layer establishes the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_port">network port</a>. This is a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the communication channels an application needs. For many types of services, these port numbers have been standardized so that client computers may address specific services of a server computer without the involvement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery">service discovery</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service">directory services</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because IP provides only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort delivery</a>, some transport-layer protocols offer reliability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> is a connection-oriented protocol that addresses numerous reliability issues in providing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_byte_stream">reliable byte stream</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>data arrives in-order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data has minimal error (i.e., correctness)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>duplicate data is discarded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lost or discarded packets are resent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes traffic congestion control</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The newer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol">Stream Control Transmission Protocol</a> (SCTP) is also a reliable, connection-oriented transport mechanism. It is message-stream-oriented, not byte-stream-oriented like TCP, and provides multiple streams multiplexed over a single connection. It also provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihoming">multihoming</a> support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, the connection is not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport SS7 over IP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reliability can also be achieved by running IP over a reliable data-link protocol such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control">High-Level Data Link Control</a> (HDLC).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">User Datagram Protocol</a> (UDP) is a connectionless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram">datagram</a> protocol. Like IP, it is a best-effort, unreliable protocol. Reliability is addressed through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection">error detection</a> using a checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for applications such as streaming media (audio, video, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">Voice over IP</a> etc.) where on-time arrival is more important than reliability, or for simple query/response applications like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol">Real-time Transport Protocol</a> (RTP) is a datagram protocol that is used over UDP and is designed for real-time data such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media">streaming media</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The applications at any given network address are distinguished by their TCP or UDP port. By convention, certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">well known ports</a> are associated with specific applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TCP/IP model&#8217;s transport or host-to-host layer corresponds roughly to the fourth layer in the OSI model, also called the transport layer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="application-layer">2.4. Application layer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">application layer</a> includes the protocols used by most applications for providing user services or exchanging application data over the network connections established by the lower level protocols. This may include some basic network support services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol">routing protocols</a> and host configuration. Examples of application layer protocols include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">File Transfer Protocol</a> (FTP), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</a> (SMTP), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a> (DHCP). Data coded according to application layer protocols are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking)">encapsulated</a> into transport layer protocol units (such as TCP streams or UDP datagrams), which in turn use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_layer_protocol">lower layer protocols</a> to effect actual data transfer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TCP/IP model does not consider the specifics of formatting and presenting data and does not define additional layers between the application and transport layers as in the OSI model (presentation and session layers). According to the TCP/IP model, such functions are the realm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">libraries</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">application programming interfaces</a>. The application layer in the TCP/IP model is often compared to a combination of the fifth (session), sixth (presentation), and seventh (application) layers of the OSI model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client–server applications, and common services have
well-known port numbers reserved by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a> (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a> uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port">ephemeral ports</a>, i.e., port numbers assigned only for the duration of the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the application layer, the TCP/IP model distinguishes between user protocols and support protocols. Support protocols provide services to a system of network infrastructure. User protocols are used for actual user applications. For example, FTP is a user protocol and DNS is a support protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the applications are usually aware of key qualities of the transport layer connection such as the endpoint IP addresses and port numbers, application layer protocols generally treat the transport layer (and lower) protocols as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black boxes</a> which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate. The transport layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with the specifics of application layer protocols. Routers and switches do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_throttling">bandwidth throttling</a> applications use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection</a> to interpret application data. An example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Reservation_Protocol">Resource Reservation Protocol</a> (RSVP). It is also sometimes necessary for Applications affected by NAT to consider the application payload.</p>
