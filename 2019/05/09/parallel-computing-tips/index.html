硬件同步原语 Hardware synchronization primitives
  Compare and swap (CAS)
    atomic test-and-set operation / atomic read-modify-write sequence
    On Intel processors, compare-and-swap is implemented by the cmpxchg family of instructions.
    A CAS operation includes three operands -- a memory location (V),
      the expected old value (A), and a new value (B).
    CAS effectively says "I think location V should have the value A; if it does, put B in it,
      otherwise, don't change it but tell me what value is there now.

锁 lock
  自旋锁 spinlock

锁的粒度
  lock overhead: the extra resources for using locks, like the memory space allocated for locks, the CPU time to initialize and destroy locks, and the time for acquiring or releasing locks. The more locks a program uses, the more overhead associated with the usage;
  lock contention: this occurs whenever one process or thread attempts to acquire a lock held by another process or thread. The more fine-grained the available locks, the less likely one process/thread will request a lock held by the other. (For example, locking a row rather than the entire table, or locking a cell rather than the entire row.);
  deadlock: the situation when each of at least two tasks is waiting for a lock that the other task holds. Unless something is done, the two tasks will wait forever.

异步 IO



A thread waiting on a construct might block forever if the thread currently holding the construct
never releases it. If the construct is a user-mode construct, the thread is running on a CPU forever, and
we call this a livelock. If the construct is a kernel-mode construct, the thread is blocked forever, and we
call this a deadlock. Both of these are bad, but of the two, a deadlock is always preferable to a livelock,
because a livelock wastes both CPU time and memory (the thread’s stack, etc.), while a deadlock wastes
only memory.

Context SWitch

Kernel Mode / User Mode

Volatile / Memory fences

Volatile’s Read method performs an atomic read operation, and its Write method performs an
atomic write operation. That is, each method performs either an atomic read operation or an atomic
write operation.

  Events
    Events are simply Boolean variables maintained by the kernel.
    true / false
    unblock / block
    AutoSet: unblock a thread then set event to false
    ManualSet: unblock all thread, set event to false yourself

    SpinWait based autoresetwaithandle:
      forces the calling thread to transition from managed code to the kernel and back—which is bad. But when there is contention, the losing thread is blocked by the kernel and is not spinning and wasting CPU cycles—which is good.
  Semaphore
    Semaphores are simply Int32 variables maintained by the kernel. A thread waiting on a semaphore blocks when the semaphore is 0 and unblocks when the semaphore is greater than 0. When a thread waiting on a semaphore unblocks, the kernel automatically subtracts 1 from the semaphore’s count.
  Mutex
    A Mutex represents a mutual-exclusive lock. It works similar to an AutoResetEvent or a Semaphore with a count of 1 since all three constructs release only one waiting thread at a time.
    System.ApplicationException
    System.Threading.AbandonedMutexException
    recursion count
    Usually a recursive lock is needed when a method takes a lock and then calls another method that also requires the lock

  Hybrid Constructs
    Spinning / Thread OwnerShip / Recursion

    Monitor / lock
      Sync block index
      public / private lock object
    ReadWriterLockSlim
      Recusion / Thread Ownership / upgrade
    CountdownEvent
      This construct blocks a thread until its internal counter reaches 0.

Instead, you should use the thread pool to rent threads for short periods of time. So, a thread
pool thread starts out spell checking, then it changes to grammar checking, and then it changes again
to perform work on behalf of a client request, and so on.

In addition, avoid using recursive locks (especially recursive reader-writer locks) because they hurt
performance. However, Monitor is recursive and its performance is very good.77 Also, avoid releasing
a lock in a finally block because entering and leaving exception-handling blocks incurs a
performance hit, and if an exception is thrown while mutating state, then the state is corrupted, and
other threads that manipulate it will experience unpredictable behavior and security bugs.

In the CLR, calling any lock method is a full memory fence, and any variable writes you have before the fence must complete before the fence and any variable reads after the fence must start after it.
