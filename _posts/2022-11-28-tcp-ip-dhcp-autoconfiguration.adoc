To make use of the TCP/IP protocol suite, each host and router requires a certain amount of configuration information.

* Every interface to be used with TCP/IP networking requires an

** _IP address_,
** _subnet mask_, and
** _broadcast address_ (for IPv4).

* To engage in communication beyond the local subnet, called _indirect delivery_, a system requires a _routing or forwarding table_ that indicates what router(s) are to be used for reaching various destinations.

* To be able to use services such as the Web and e-mail, the _DNS_ is used to map user-friendly domain names to the IP addresses required by the lower-protocol layers.

* To use _Mobile IP_, a system also needs to know how to find a _home agent_.

All in all, having an _IP address_, _subnet mask_, and the IP address of a _DNS server_ and _router_ are the _bare essentials_ to get a system running on the Internet that is capable of using or providing popular services such as Web and e-mail.

Beyond the bare essentials, there are numerous other bits of configuration information a host or router may require, depending on the types of services it uses or provides.

* These may include the locations of _home agents_, _multicast routers_, _VPN gateways_, and _Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)/VoIP gateways_.

== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP [RFC2131] is a popular client/server protocol used to assign configuration information to hosts (and, less frequently, to routers).

DHCP is very widely used, in both enterprises and home networks.

* Even the most basic home router devices support embedded DHCP servers.

* DHCP clients are incorporated into all common client operating systems and a large number of embedded devices such as network printers and VoIP phones.
+
Such devices usually use DHCP to acquire their _IP address_, _subnet mask_, _router IP address_, and _DNS server IP address_.

* Information pertaining to other services (e.g., SIP servers used with VoIP) may also be conveyed using DHCP.

* DHCP was originally conceived for use with IPv4, IPv6 can also use a version of DHCP called DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

The design of DHCP is based on an earlier protocol called the Internet _Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)_ [RFC0951][RFC1542], which is now effectively obsolete.

* BOOTP provides limited configuration information to clients and does not have a mechanism to support changing that information after it has been provided.

* DHCP extends the BOOTP model with the concept of _leases_ and can provide all information required for a host to operate.
+
Leases allow clients to use the configuration information for an agreed-upon amount of time.
+
A client may request to renew the lease and continue operations, subject to agreement from the DHCP server.

BOOTP and DHCP are backward-compatible in the sense that BOOTP-only clients can make use of DHCP servers and DHCP clients can make use of BOOTP-only servers.

* BOOTP, and therefore DHCP as well, is carried using UDP/IP. Clients use port _68_ and servers use port _67_.

DHCP comprises two major parts: address management and delivery of configuration data.

* Address management handles the dynamic allocation of IP addresses and provides address leases to clients.

* Configuration data delivery includes the DHCP protocol's message formats and state machines.

A DHCP server can be configured to provide three levels of address allocation: _automatic allocation_, _dynamic allocation_, and _manual allocation_.

* The most commonly used method is _dynamic allocation_, whereby a client is given a revocable IP address from a pool (usually a predefined range) of addresses configured at the server.

* In _automatic allocation_, the same method is used but the address is never revoked.

* In _manual allocation_, the DHCP protocol is used to convey the address, but the address is fixed for the requesting client (i.e., it is not part of an allocatable pool maintained by the server).

* In this last mode, DHCP acts like BOOTP.

The differences among the three have to do with whether the addresses assigned are based on the identity of the client and whether such addresses are subject to being revoked or changed.

=== Address Pools and Leases

In dynamic allocation, a DHCP client requests the allocation of an IP address.

The server responds with one address selected from a pool of available addresses.

Typically, the pool is a contiguous range of IP addresses allocated specifically for DHCP's use.

The address given to the client is allocated for only a specific amount of time, called the _lease duration_.

The client is permitted to use the IP address until the lease expires, although it may request extension of the lease as required.

In most situations, clients are able to renew leases they wish to extend.

=== DHCP and BOOTP Message Format

DHCP extends BOOTP, DHCP's predecessor. Compatibility is maintained between the protocols by defining the DHCP message format as an extension to BOOTP's in such a way that BOOTP clients can be served by DHCP servers, and BOOTP _relay agents_ can be used to support DHCP use, even on networks where DHCP servers do not reside.

.The BOOTP message format, including field names from [RFC0951], [RFC1542], and [RFC2131]. The BOOTP message format is used to hold DHCP messages by appropriate assignment of options. In this way, BOOTP relay agents can process DHCP messages, and BOOTP clients can use DHCP servers. The _Server Name_ and _Boot File Name_ fields can be used to carry DHCP options if necessary.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-dhcp-autoconfiguration/bootp-message-format.png[BOOTP Message Format,75%,75%]

The message format is defined by BOOTP and DHCP in several RFCs ([RFC0951][RFC1542][RFC2131]).

* The _Op (Operation)_ field identifies the message as either a request (_1_) or a reply (_2_).

* The _HW Type (htype)_ field is assigned based on values used with ARP and defined in the corresponding IANA ARP parameters page [IARP], with the value _1 (Ethernet)_ being very common.

* The _HW Len (hlen)_ field gives the number of bytes used to hold the hardware (MAC) address and is commonly _6_ for Ethernet-like networks.

* The _Hops_ field is used to store the number of relays through which the message has traveled.
+
The sender of the message sets this value to _0_, and it is incremented at each relay.

* The _Transaction ID_ is a (random) number chosen by the client and copied into responses by the server.
+
It is used to match replies with requests.

* The _Secs_ field is set by the client with the number of seconds that have elapsed since the first attempt to establish or renew an address.

* The _Flags_ field currently contains only a single defined bit called the _broadcast_ flag.
+
Clients may set this bit in requests if they are unable or unwilling to process incoming unicast IP datagrams but can process incoming broadcast datagrams (e.g., because they do not yet have an IP address).
+
Setting the bit informs the server and relays that broadcast addressing should be used for replies.

* The _Client IP Address (ciaddr)_ field includes a current IP address of the requestor, if known, and is _0_ otherwise.

* The _Your IP Address (yiaddr)_ field is filled in by a server when providing an address to a requesting client.

* The _Next Server IP Address (siaddr)_ field gives the IP address of the next server to use for the client's bootstrap process (e.g., if the client needs to download an operating system image that may be accomplished from a server other than the DHCP server).

* The _Gateway (or Relay) IP Address (giaddr)_ field is filled in by a DHCP or BOOTP relay with its address when forwarding DHCP (BOOTP) messages.

* The _Client Hardware Address (chaddr)_ field holds a unique identifier of the client and can be used in various ways by the server, including arranging for the same IP address to be given each time a particular client makes an address request.
+
This field has traditionally held the client's MAC address, which has been used as an identifier.
+
Nowadays, the Client Identifier, an option is preferred for this use.

* The remaining fields include the _Server Name (sname)_ and _Boot File Name (file)_ fields.
+
These fields are not always filled in, but if they are, they contain 64 or 128 bytes, respectively, of ASCII characters indicating the name of the server or path to the boot file. Such strings are null-terminated, as in the C programming language.
=
They can also be used instead to hold DHCP options if space is tight.

* The final field, originally known as the _Vendor Extensions_ field in BOOTP and fixed in length, is now known as the _Options_ field and is variable in length.
+
As we shall see, options are used extensively with DHCP and are required to distinguish DHCP messages from legacy BOOTP messages.

=== DHCP and BOOTP Options

Given that DHCP extends BOOTP, any fields needed by DHCP that were not present when BOOTP was designed are carried as options.

* Options take a standard format beginning with an 8-bit tag indicating the option type.

* For some options, a fixed number of bytes following the tag contain the option value.

* All others consist of the tag followed by 1 byte containing the length of the option value (not including the tag or length), followed by a variable number of bytes containing the option value itself.

A large number of options are available with DHCP, some of which are also supported by BOOTP.

* The current list is given by the BOOTP/DHCP parameters page.
* The first 77 options, including the most common ones, are specified in [RFC2132].
* Common options include _Pad (0)_, _Subnet Mask (1)_, _Router Address (3)_, _Domain Name Server (6)_, _Domain Name (15)_, _Requested IP Address (50)_, _Address Lease Time (51)_, _DHCP Message Type (53)_, _Server Identifier (54)_, _Parameter Request List (55)_, _DHCP Error Message (56)_, _Lease Renewal Time (58)_, _Lease Rebinding Time (59)_, _Client Identifier (61)_, _Domain Search List (119)_, and _End (255)_.

The DHCP _Message Type option (53)_ is a 1-byte-long option that is always used with DHCP messages and has the following possible values: _DHCPDISCOVER (1)_, _DHCPOFFER (2)_, _DHCPREQUEST (3)_, _DHCPDECLINE (4)_, _DHCPACK (5)_, _DHCPNAK (6)_, _DHCPRELEASE (7)_, _DHCPINFORM (8)_, _DHCPFORCERENEW (9)_ [RFC3203], _DHCPLEASEQUERY (10)_, _DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED (11)_, _DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN (12)_, and _DHCPLEASEACTIVE (13)_.

=== DHCP Protocol Operation

DHCP messages are essentially BOOTP messages with a special set of options.

* When a new client attaches to a network, it first discovers what DHCP servers are available and what addresses they are offering.
* It then decides which server to use and which address it desires and requests it from the offering server (while informing all the servers of its choice).
* Unless the server has given away the address in the meantime, it responds by acknowledging the address allocation to the requesting client.
+
.A typical DHCP exchange. A client discovers a set of servers and addresses they are offering using broadcast messages, requests the address it desires, and receives an acknowledgment from the selected server. The transaction ID (xid) allows requests and responses to be matched up, and the server ID (an option) indicates which server is providing and committing the provided address binding with the client. If the client already knows the address it desires, the protocol can be simplified to include use of only the REQUEST and ACK messages.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-dhcp-autoconfiguration/dhcp-bootp-exchange.png[DHCP Exchange,55%,55%]

* Requesting clients set the BOOTP _Op_ field to BOOTREQUEST and the first 4 bytes of the _Options_ field to the decimal values 99, 130, 83, and 99, respectively (the magic cookie value from [RFC2132]).

* Messages from client to server are sent as UDP/IP datagrams containing a BOOTP BOOTREQUEST operation and an appropriate DHCP message type (usually DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST).
+
Such messages are sent from address _0.0.0.0_ (port _68_) to the limited broadcast address _255.255.255.255_ (port _67_).

* Messages traveling in the other direction (from server to client) are sent from the IP address of the server and port _67_ to the IP local broadcast address and port _68_.

It is also possible to induce a system to perform the release or acquisition of DHCP configuration information by hand. For example, in Windows the following command will release the data acquired using DHCP:

[source,console]
----
C:\> ipconfig /release
----

and the following command will acquire it:

[source,console]
----
C:\> ipconfig /renew
----

In Linux, the following commands can be used to achieve the same results:

[source,console]
----
Linux# dhclient -r
----

to release a DHCP lease, and

[source,console]
----
Linux# dhclient
----

to renew one.

=== The DHCP State Machine

The DHCP protocol operates a state machine at the clients and servers. The states dictate which types of messages the protocol is expecting to process next.

.The DHCP client state machine. The boldface states and transitions are typical for a client first acquiring a leased address. The dashed line and INIT state are where the protocol begins.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-dhcp-autoconfiguration/dhcp-client-states.png[DHCP client state machine,45%,45%]

== DHCPv6

Although the IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP protocols achieve conceptually similar goals, their respective protocol designs and deployment options differ.

DHCPv6 [RFC3315] can be used in either a "_stateful_" mode, in which it works much like DHCPv4, or in a "_stateless_" mode in conjunction with stateless address autoconfiguration.

In the stateless mode, IPv6 clients are assumed to selfconfigure their IPv6 addresses but require additional information (e.g., DNS server address) obtained using DHCPv6. Another option exists for deriving the location of a DNS server using ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.

=== IPv6 Address Lifecycle

IPv6 hosts usually operate with _multiple addresses per interface_, and each address has a set of timers indicating how long and for what purposes the corresponding address can be used.

In IPv6, addresses are assigned with a _preferred lifetime_ and _valid lifetime_.

These lifetimes are used to form timeouts that move an address from one state to another in an address’s state machine.

.The lifecycle of an IPv6 address. Tentative addresses are used only for DAD until verified as unique. After that, they become preferred and can be used without restriction until an associated timeout changes their state to deprecated. Deprecated addresses are not to be used for initiating new connections and may not be used at all after the associated valid timeout expires.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-dhcp-autoconfiguration/ipv6-address-lifecycle.png[IPv6 Address Lifecycle,55%,55%]

* An address is in the preferred state when it is available for general use and is available as either a source or destination IPv6 address.

* A preferred address becomes deprecated when its preferred timeout occurs.
+
When it becomes deprecated, it may still be used for existing transport (e.g., TCP) connections but is not to be used for initiating new connections.

* When an address is first selected for use, it enters a _tentative_ or _optimistic state_.
+
When in the tentative state, it may be used only for the _IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol_. It is not used as a source or destination address for any other purposes. While in this state the address is being checked for duplication, to see if any other nodes on the same network are already using the address. The procedure for doing this is called _duplicate address detection (DAD)_.
+
An alternative to conventional DAD is called _optimistic DAD_ [RFC4429], whereby a selected address is used for a limited set of purposes until DAD completes. Because an optimistic use of an address is really just a special set of rules for DAD, it is not a truly complete state itself. Optimistic addresses are treated as deprecated for most purposes. In particular, an address may be both optimistic and deprecated simultaneously, depending on the preferred and valid lifetimes.

=== DHCPv6 Message Format

DHCPv6 messages are encapsulated as UDP/IPv6 datagrams, with client port _546_ and server port _547_. Messages are sent using a _host's link-scoped source address_ to either relay agents or servers.

There are two message formats, one used directly between a client and a server, and another when a relay is used.

.The basic DHCPv6 message format (left) and relay agent message format (right). Most interesting information in DHCPv6 is carried in options.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-dhcp-autoconfiguration/dhcpv6-message-format.png[DHCPv6 Message Format,75%,75%]

The format on the right is used between a DHCPv6 relay agent and a DHCPv6 server.

* The _Link Address_ field gives the global IPv6 address used by the server to identify the link on which the client is located.
* The _Peer Address_ field contains the address of the relay agent or client from which the message to be relayed was received.
* Note that relaying may be chained, so a relay may be relaying a message received from another relay.

The message type for messages in the format on the left include typical DHCPstyle messages (REQUEST, REPLY, etc.), whereas the message types for messages in the format on the right include RELAY-FORW and RELAY-REPL, to indicate a message forwarded from a relay or destined to a relay, respectively. The Options field for the format on the right always includes a Relay Message option, which includes the complete message being forwarded by the relay. Other options may also be included.

One of the differences between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 is how DHCPv6 uses IPv6 multicast addressing.

* Clients send requests to the All DHCP Relay Agents and Servers multicast address (_ff02::1:2_).
* Source addresses are of link-local scope.

In IPv6, there is no legacy BOOTP message format. The message semantics, however, are similar.

.DHCPv6 message types, values, and defining standards. The approximately equivalent message types for DHCPv4 are given to the right.

In DHCPv6, most interesting information, including addresses, lease times, location of services, and client and server identifiers, is carried in options. Two of the more important concepts used with these options are called the _Identity Association (IA)_ and the _DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID)_.

=== Identity Association (IA)

An *Identity Association (IA)* is an identifier used between a DHCP client and server to refer to a collection of addresses.

* Each IA comprises an _IA identifier (IAID)_ and associated configuration information.

* Each client interface that requests a DHCPv6-assigned address requires at least one IA.

* Each IA can be associated with only a single interface.

* The client chooses the IAID to uniquely identify each IA, and this value is then shared with the server.

The configuration information associated with an IA includes one or more addresses and associated lease information (T1, T2, and total lease duration values).

Each address in an IA has both a preferred and a valid lifetime [RFC4862], which define the address's lifecycle.

The types of addresses requested may be regular addresses or _temporary addresses_ [RFC4941].

* Temporary addresses are derived in part from random numbers to help improve privacy by frustrating the tracking of IPv6 hosts based on IPv6 addresses.

* Temporary addresses are ordinarily assigned at the same time nontemporary addresses are assigned but are regenerated using a different random number more frequently.

When responding to a request, a server assigns one or more addresses to a client's IA based on a set of _address assignment policies_ determined by the server's administrator.

Generally, such policies depend on the link on which the request arrived, standard information about the client, and other information supplied by the client in DHCP options.

.The format for a DHCPv6 IA for nontemporary addresses (left) and temporary addresses (right). Each option may include additional options describing particular IPv6 addresses and corresponding leases.

== Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

While most routers have their addresses configured manually, hosts can be assigned addresses manually, using an assignment protocol like DHCP, or automatically using some sort of algorithm.

There are two forms of automatic assignment, depending on what type of address is being formed.

* For addresses that are to be used only on a single link (link-local addresses), a host need only find some appropriate address not already in use on the link.

* For addresses that are to be used for global connectivity, however, some portion of the address must generally be managed.

There are mechanisms in both IPv4 and IPv6 for link-local address autoconfiguration, whereby a host determines its address(es) largely without help. This is called _stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)_.

=== Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses

In cases where a host without a manually configured address attaches to a network lacking a DHCP server, IP-based communication is unable to take place unless the host somehow generates an IP address to use.

* [RFC3927] describes a mechanism whereby a host can automatically generate its own IPv4 address from the link-local range _169.254.1.1_ through _169.254.254.254_ using the 16-bit subnet mask _255.255.0.0_ (see [RFC5735]).
+
This method is known as dynamic link-local address configuration or _Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)_.

* In essence, a host selects a random address in the range to use and checks to see if that address is already in use by some other system on the subnetwork.
+
This check is implemented using _IPv4 ACD_.

=== IPv6 SLAAC for Link-Local Addresses

The goal of IPv6 SLAAC is to allow nodes to automatically (and autonomously) self-assign link-local IPv6 addresses. IPv6 SLAAC is described in [RFC4862]. It
