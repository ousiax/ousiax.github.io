The *HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security`* response header (often abbreviated as *HSTS*) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 

== Syntax

[source,console]
----
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; includeSubDomains
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; preload
----

== Directives

* `max-age=<expire-time>`
+
The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.

* `includeSubDomains` `Optional`
+
If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all of the site's subdomains as well.
+
[NOTE]
====
6.1.2.  The includeSubDomains Directive

The OPTIONAL "includeSubDomains" directive is a valueless directive
which, if present (i.e., it is "asserted"), signals the UA that the
HSTS Policy *applies to this HSTS Host as well as any subdomains of
the host's domain name*.

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2
====

* `preload` `Optional`
+
See link:#xx[Preloading Strict Transport Security] for details. Not part of the specification.

== Description

If a website accepts a connection through HTTP and redirects to HTTPS, visitors may initially communicate with the non-encrypted version of the site before being redirected, if, for example, the visitor types \http://www.foo.com/ or even just foo.com. This creates an opportunity for a *man-in-the-middle attack*. The redirect could be exploited to direct visitors to a malicious site instead of the secure version of the original site.

The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using HTTP to HTTPS requests instead. 

[NOTE]
====
The Strict-Transport-Security header is ignored by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP; this is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove it. When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the *Strict-Transport-Security* header. 
====

=== An example scenario

You log into a free WiFi access point at an airport and start surfing the web, visiting your online banking service to check your balance and pay a couple of bills. Unfortunately, the access point you're using is actually a hacker's laptop, and they're intercepting your original HTTP request and redirecting you to a clone of your bank's site instead of the real thing. Now your private data is exposed to the hacker.

Strict Transport Security resolves this problem; as long as you've accessed your bank's web site once using HTTPS, and the bank's web site uses Strict Transport Security, your browser will know to automatically use only HTTPS, which prevents hackers from performing this sort of man-in-the-middle attack.

=== How the browser handles it

The first time your site is accessed using HTTPS and it returns the Strict-Transport-Security header, the browser records this information, so that future attempts to load the site using HTTP will automatically use HTTPS instead.

When the expiration time specified by the Strict-Transport-Security header elapses, the next attempt to load the site via HTTP will proceed as normal instead of automatically using HTTPS.

_Whenever the *Strict-Transport-Security* header is delivered to the browser, it will update the expiration time for that site, so sites can refresh this information and prevent the timeout from expiring. Should it be necessary to disable Strict Transport Security, setting the *max-age to 0* (over an https connection) will immediately expire the Strict-Transport-Security header, allowing access via http._

== Preloading Strict Transport Security

Google maintains an https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/manager/ssl/nsSTSPreloadList.inc[HSTS preload service]. By following the guidelines and successfully submitting your domain, browsers will never connect to your domain using an insecure connection. While the service is hosted by Google, all browsers have stated an intent to use (or actually started using) the preload list. However, it is not part of the HSTS specification and should not be treated as official.

* Information regarding the HSTS preload list in Chrome : https://www.chromium.org/hsts
* Consultation of the Firefox HSTS preload list : https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/manager/ssl/nsSTSPreloadList.inc[nsSTSPreloadList.inc]

== Examples

All present and future subdomains will be HTTPS for a `max-age` of 1 year. This blocks access to pages or subdomains that can only be served over HTTP.

[source,console]
----
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
----

If a `max-age` of 1 year is acceptable for a domain, however, two years is the recommended value as explained on https://hstspreload.org.

In the following example, `max-age` is set to 2 years, and is suffixed with preload, which is necessary for inclusion in most major web browsers' HSTS preload lists, like Chromium, Edge, and Firefox.

[source,console]
----
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload

=== Import CA root certificates

==== Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)

[source,console]
----
$ curl -iI https://local.io
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
----

Installing the root certificate on a Linux PC is straight forward:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra
$ sudo cp local.io.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra/
$ sudo update-ca-certificates
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...

Adding debian:local.io.pem
done.
done.
----

After these steps the new CA is known by system utilities like curl and get.
