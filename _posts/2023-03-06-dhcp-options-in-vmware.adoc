. Edit _vmnetdhcp.conf_ at _%ProgramData%\VMware\vmnetdhcp.conf_

The following is a sample which was reconfigured the DHCP subnet from `192.168.227.0/24` to `192.168.91.0/24`.

# Windows NAT configuration file

# NAT gateway address
ip = 192.168.91.2/24
hostMAC = 00:50:56:C0:00:08

. Edit startup parametes of _VMware DHCP Service_ at  _HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\VMnetDHCP\Parameters\VirtualEthernetSegments\8\HostIpAddress_.
+
Please note that address has reverse HEX notation. e.g. <<1>>
+
192.168.1.1 is reversed to 1.1.168.192 and key value is 0101A8C0
+
According to the above sample, we should update this value to `15ba8c0`, which is `192.168.91.1`.

. Now, we need to restart the both the _VMware DHCP Service_ and _VMware NAT Service_ using Windows Services Manager.
