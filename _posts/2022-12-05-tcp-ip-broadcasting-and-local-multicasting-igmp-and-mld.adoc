There are four kinds of IP addresses: *unicast*, *anycast*, *multicast*, and *broadcast*.

At the present time, multicast is used more in enterprise and local networks than in the wide area.

Broadcasting and multicasting provide two services for an application: delivery of packets to multiple destinations, and solicitation/discovery of servers by clients.

* Delivery to multiple destinations
+
There are many applications that deliver information to multiple recipients: interactive conferencing and dissemination of mail or news to multiple recipients, for example.
+
Without broadcasting or multicasting, these types of services tend to use TCP today (delivering a separate copy to each destination, which can be very inefficient).

* Solicitation of servers by clients
+
Using broadcasting or multicasting, an application can send a request for a server without knowing any particular server's IP address.
+
A laptop, for example, might need to get its initial IP address and find its nearest router using DHCP when little is known about the local networking environment.

Although both broadcasting and multicasting can provide these important capabilities, 

* multicasting is generally preferable to broadcasting because multicasting involves only those systems that support or use a particular service or protocol, and broadcasting does not.

* Thus, a broadcast request affects all hosts that are reachable within the scope of the broadcast, whereas multicast affects only those hosts that are likely to be interested in the request.

Broadcasting has been supported by the IPv4 protocol since its inception, and multicast was added with the publication of [RFC1112].

*IPv6 supports multicasting but does not support broadcasting.*

Generally, only user applications that use the

* UDP transport protocol take advantage of broadcasting and multicasting, where it makes sense for an application to send a single message to multiple recipients.
* TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that implies a connection between two hosts (specified by IP addresses) and one process on each host (specified by port numbers).
+
TCP can use unicast and anycast addresses (recall that anycast addresses behave like unicast addresses), but not broadcast or multicast addresses.

Broadcasting and multicasting are also used by important system processes such as routing protocols, ARP, ND in IPv6, and others.

Multicasting is an important but arguably optional feature in IPv4, but it is mandatory in IPv6 because of its use in ND, a service critical even to unicast communication.

== Broadcasting

Broadcasting refers to sending a message to all possible receivers in a network.

In principle, this is simple: a router simply forwards a copy of any message it receives out of every interface other than the one on which the message arrived.

Consider a set of hosts on a network such as an Ethernet that supports broadcasting at the link layer.

* Each Ethernet frame contains the source and destination MAC addresses (48-bit values).

* Normally, each IP packet is destined for a single host, so unicast addressing is used and the destination's unique MAC address is determined using ARP or IPv6 ND. 
+
When a frame is sent to a unicast destination in this way, communication between any two hosts does not bother any of the remaining hosts on the network.
+
For switched Ethernet networks, these are the types of addresses found in the station caches in switches and bridges.

* There are times, however, when a host wants to send a frame to every other host on the network (or VLAN)—this is called a *broadcast*.

=== Using Broadcast Addresses

On an Ethernet or similar network, a multicast MAC address has the low-order bit of the high-order byte turned on.

* In hexadecimal this looks like _01:00:00:00:00:00_.

* We may consider the Ethernet broadcast address _ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff_ as a special case of the Ethernet multicast address.

Recall that in IPv4, each subnet has

* a _local subnet-directed broadcast address_ formed by placing _all 1 bits in the host portion of the address_,

* and the special address _255.255.255.255_ corresponds to a local network (also called _limited_) broadcast.

[TIP]
====
Directed broadcasts are routable in principle but won't be forwarded by default.

Limited broadcasts are generally not routable and won't be forwarded.

Here, the address _192.168.91.255_ is the (subnet-directed) broadcast address used on the network to which device _ens32_ is attached.

* This address is formed by taking the network prefix (_192.168.91.0/24_) and combining it with 32 – 24 = 8 bits of 1s in the host portion of the address: _192.168.91.0 OR 0.0.0.255 = 192.68.91.255_.

* A simple utility called _ipcalc_ or _ipcalc-ng_ is available on some systems to perform this calculation.

----

* An ICMPv4 Echo Request message sent to the _directed broadcast address_ on the local subnetwork is encapsulated in a _link-layer broadcast_ frame with a destination address of all 1s.
* The source addresses at both the IP and link layers are entirely conventional unicast; multicast addresses are used only as destination addresses.

== Multicasting

To reduce the amount of overhead involved in broadcasting, it is possible to send traffic only to those receivers that are interested in it. This is called *multicasting*.

Fundamentally, this is accomplished by either having the sender indicate the receivers, or instead having the receivers independently indicate their interest. The network then becomes responsible for sending traffic only to intended/interested recipients.

Implementing multicast is considerably more challenging than broadcast because _multicast state_ (information) must be maintained by hosts and routers as to what traffic is of interest to what receivers.

* In the TCP/IP model of multicasting, receivers indicate their interest in what traffic they wish to receive by specifying a multicast address and optional list of sources.
+
This information is maintained as _soft state_ within hosts and routers, meaning that it must be updated regularly or it will time out and be deleted.
+
When this happens, delivery of multicast traffic either ceases or reverts to broadcast.

ASM (any-source multicast)

* IP multicasting originated using a design based on the way _group addressing_ works in link-layer networks such as Ethernet.
+
Each station selects the group address for which it is willing to accept traffic, also sometimes called _any-source multicast_ (ASM) because of the insensitivity to the identity of the sender.

SSM (source-specific multicast)

* An alternative form that is sensitive to the identity of the sender called _source-specific multicast_ (SSM) [RFC4607] that allows end stations to explicitly include or exclude traffic sent to a _multicast group_ from a particular set of senders.

=== Converting IP Multicast Addresses to 802 MAC/Ethernet Addresses

When using unicast addresses on Ethernet-like networks, ARP is usually used to determine a local destination's MAC address given its IPv4 address. In IPv6, ND serves a similar role.

When we looked at broadcasting earlier, we noticed that there is a single well-known broadcast MAC address that can always be used to reach all stations on a LAN or VLAN.

What destination MAC address should be placed in a link-layer frame when we wish to send multicast traffic?

To carry IP multicast efficiently on a link-layer on IEEE 802 networks, there should be a one-to-one mapping between packets and addresses at the IP layer and frames at the link layer.

* The IANA owns the IEEE _Organizationally Unique Identifier_ (abbreviated _OUI_, or more informally _Ethernet address prefix_) _00:00:5e_.
+
With it, IANA is given the right to use group (multicast) MAC addresses starting with _01:00:5e_ as well as unicast addresses starting with _00:00:5e_.
+
This prefix is used as the high-order 24 bits of the Ethernet address, meaning that this block includes unicast addresses in the range _00:00:5e:00:00:00_ through _00:00:5e:ff:ff:ff_ and group addresses in the range _01:00:5e:00:00:00_ through _01:00:5e:ff:ff:ff_.

* Other organizations besides IANA own address blocks as well, but only IANA devotes some of its space to support of IP multicasting.

The IANA allocates half of its group block to identifying IPv4 multicast traffic on IEEE 802 LANs, which means that the Ethernet addresses corresponding to IPv4 multicasting are in the range _01:00:5e:00:00:00_ through _01:00:5e:7f:ff:ff_.

.The IPv4-to-IEEE-802 MAC multicast address mapping uses the lower-order 23 bits of the IPv4 group address as the suffix of a MAC address starting with 01:00:5e. Because only 23 of the 28 group address bits are used, 32 groups are mapped to the same MAC-layer address.

IPv4 multicast addresses are contained within the address space from _224.0.0.0_ to _239.255.255.255_ (formerly known as class D address space). All such addresses share a common 4-bit sequence of _1110_ in the high-order bits.

For IPv6, the 16-bit OUI hexadecimal prefix is _33:33_, which means that the last _32_ bits of the IPv6 address can be used to form the link-layer address. All IPv6 multicast addresses begin with _ff_, and the subsequent 8 bits are used for flags and scope information, this leaves 128 – 16 = 112 bits for representing groups.

.The IPv6-to-IEEE-802 MAC multicast address mapping uses the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address as the suffix of a MAC address starting with 33:33. Because only 32 of the 112 multicast address bits are used, 2+++^+++80 groups are mapped to the same MAC-layer address.

=== Receiving Multicast Datagrams

Fundamental to multicasting is the concept of a process _joining_ or _leaving_ one or more multicast groups on a given interface on a host.

Membership in a multicast group on a given interface is dynamic—it changes over time as processes join and leave groups.

In addition to joining or leaving groups, additional methods are needed if a process wishes to specify sources it cares to hear from or exclude.

A process can join the same group on multiple interfaces, multiple groups on the same interface, or any combination thereof.

=== Host Address Filtering

In a typical switched Ethernet environment, broadcast and multicast frames are replicated on all segments within a VLAN, along a spanning tree formed among the switches. Such frames are delivered to the NIC on each host which checks the correctness of the frame (using the CRC) and makes a decision about whether to receive the frame and deliver it to the device driver and network stack.

Normally the NIC receives only those frames whose destination address is either the hardware address of the interface or the broadcast address.

However, when multicast frames are involved, the situation is somewhat more complicated.

.Each layer implements filtering on some portion of the received message. MAC address filtering can take place in either software or hardware. Cheaper NICs tend to impose a larger processing burden on software because they perform fewer functions in hardware.

== The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD)

When multicast datagrams are to be forwarded over a wide area network or within an enterprise across multiple subnets, we require that _multicast routing_ be enabled by one or more multicast routers.

Two major protocols are used to allow multicast routers to learn the groups in which nearby hosts are interested:

* the *Internet Group Management Protocol* (IGMP) used by IPv4
* and the *Multicast Listener Discovery* (MLD) protocol used by IPv6.

.IGMP is encapsulated as a separate protocol in IPv4. MLD is a type of ICMPv6 message.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/broadcasting-and-local-multicasting-igmp-and-mld/igmp-mld-message-format.png[IGMP/MLD Message,75%,75%]

While IGMP is a separate protocol used with IPv4, MLD is really part of ICMPv6.

.Multicast routers send IGMP (MLD) requests to each attached subnet periodically to determine which groups and sources are of interest to the attached hosts. Hosts respond with reports indicating which groups and sources are of interest. Hosts may also send unsolicited reports if membership changes occur.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/broadcasting-and-local-multicasting-igmp-and-mld/igmp-mld-multicast-routers.png[Multicast routers send IGMP (MLD) requests,55%,55%]

* IGMP (MLD) queries are sent by multicast routers to the All Hosts multicast address, _224.0.0.1_ (IGMP), or the All Nodes link-scope multicast address, _ff02::1_ (MLD), and processed by every host implementing IP multicast.

* Membership report messages are sent by group members (hosts) in response to the queries but may also be sent in an unsolicited way from hosts that wish to inform multicast routers that their group membership(s) and/or interest in particular sources has changed.

** IGMPv3 reports are sent to the IGMPv3-capable multicast router address _224.0.0.22_.
** MLDv2 reports are sent to the corresponding MLDv2 Listeners IPv6 multicast address _ff02::16_.

* Note that multicast routers themselves may also act as members when they join multicast groups.
