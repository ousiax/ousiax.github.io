TCP/IP supports many different link layers, depending on the type of networking hardware being used:

* wired LANs such as Ethernet,
* metropolitan area networks (MANs) such as cable TV and DSL connections available through service providers,
* and wired voice networks such as telephone lines with modems,
* as well as the more recent wireless networks such as Wi-Fi (wireless LAN)
* and various wireless data services based on cellular technlology such as HSPA, EV-DO, LTE, and WiMAX.

Most link-layer technologies have an associated protocol format that describes how the corresponding PDUs must be constructed in order to be carried by the network hardware.

When referring to link-layer PDUs, we usually use the term *frame*, so as to distinguish the PDU format from those at higher layers such as *packets* or *segments*, terms used to describe network- and transport-layer PDUs, respectively.

Frame formats usually support a variable-length frame size ranging from a few bytes to a few kilobytes. The upper bound of the range is called the *maximum transmission unit* (*MTU*).

== Ethernet and the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards

The term *Ethernet* generally refers to a set of standards first published in 1980 and revised in 1982 by Digital Equipment Corp., Intel Corp., and Xerox Corp. The first common form of Ethernet is now sometimes called "10Mb/s Ethernet" or "shared Ethernet," and it was adopted (with minor changes) by the IEEE as standard number 802.3.

.A basic shared Ethernet network consists of one or more stations (e.g., workstations, supercomputers) attached to a shared cable segment. Link-layer PDUs (frames) can be sent from one station to one or more others when the medium is determined to be free. If multiple stations send at the same time, possibly because of signal propagation delays, a collision occurs. Collisions can be detected, and they cause sending stations to wait a random amount of time before retrying. This common scheme is called carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-link-layer/shared-ethernet-network.png[A basic shared Ethernet network,45%,45%]

Because multiple stations share the same network, this standard includes a distributed algorithm implemented in each Ethernet network interface that controls when a station gets to send data it has. The particular method, known as *carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection* (*CSMA/CD*), mediates which computers can access the shared medium (cable) without any other special agreement or synchronization. This relative simplicity helped to promote the low cost and resulting popularity of Ethernet technology.

With CSMA/CD, a station (e.g., computer) first looks for a signal currently being sent on the network and sends its own frame when the network is free. This is the "carrier sense" portion of the protocol. If some other station happens to send at the same time, the resulting overlapping electrical signal is detected as a collision. In this case, each station waits a random amount of time before trying again. The amount of time is selected by drawing from a uniform probability distribution that doubles in length each time a subsequent collision is detected.

Eventually, each station gets its chance to send or times out trying after some number of attempts (16 in the case of conventional Ethernet). With CSMA/CD,
only one frame is traveling on the network at any given time. Access methods such as CSMA/CD are more formally called *Media Access Control* (*MAC*) protocols. There are many types of MAC protocols; some are based on having each station try to use the network independently (contention-based protocols like CSMA/ CD), and others are based on prearranged coordination (e.g., by allocating time slots for each station to send).

By the early 1990s, the shared cable had largely been replaced by twisted-pair wiring (resembling telephone wires and often called "10BASE-T"). With the development of 100Mb/s (also called "fast Ethernet," the most popular version of which is known as "100BASE-TX"), contention-based MAC protocols have become less popular. Instead, the wiring between each LAN station is often not shared but instead provides a dedicated electrical path in a star topology. This can be accomplished with Ethernet *switches*.

.A switched Ethernet network consists of one or more stations, each of which is attached to a switch port using a dedicated wiring path. In most cases where switched Ethernet is used, the network operates in a full-duplex fashion and the CSMA/CD algorithm is not required. Switches may be cascaded to form larger Ethernet LANs by interconnecting switch ports, sometimes called "uplink" ports.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-link-layer/switched-ethernet-network.png[A switched Ethernet network,35%,35%]

At present, switches are commonly used, providing each Ethernet station with the ability to send and receive data simultaneously (called "full-duplex Ethernet").

One of the most popular technologies used to access the Internet today is wireless networking, the most common for wireless local area networks (WLANs) being an IEEE standard known as Wireless Fidelity or *Wi-Fi*, and sometimes called "wireless Ethernet" or 802.11. Although this standard is distinct from the 802 wired Ethernet standards, the frame format and general interface are largely borrowed from 802.3, and all are part of the set of IEEE 802 LAN standards. Thus, most of the capabilities used by TCP/IP for Ethernet networks are also used for Wi-Fi networks.

=== The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards

In the world of IEEE standards, standards with the prefix 802 define the operations of LANs and MANs. The most popular 802 standards today include 802.3 (essentially Ethernet) and 802.11 (WLAN/Wi-Fi).

=== The Ethernet Frame Format

The Ethernet frame begins with a *_Preamble_* area used by the receiving interface's circuitry to determine when a frame is arriving and to determine the amount of time between encoded bits (called *clock recovery*).

The preamble is a recognizable pattern (_0xAA_ typically), which the receiver can use to _recover the clock_ by the time the *start frame delimiter* (_SFD_) is found. The SFD has the fixed value _0xAB_.

All Ethernet (802.3) frames are based on a common format.

This basic frame format includes 48-bit (6-byte) *_Destination (DST)_* and *_Source (SRC)_* Address fields, known by other names such as _MAC address_, _link-layer address_, _802 address_, _hardware address_, or _physical address_. The destination address is also allowed to address more than one station, called *_broadcast_* or *_multicast_*.

Following the source address is a *_Type_* field that doubles as a *_Length_* field. Ordinarily, it identifies the type of data that follows the header. Popular values used with TCP/IP networks include IPv4 (_0x0800_), IPv6 (_0x86DD_), and ARP (_0x0806_).

The value 0x8100 indicates a *_Q-tagged_* frame (i.e., one that can carry a _virtual LAN_ or _VLAN ID_ according to the 802.1q standard).

The size of a basic Ethernet frame is 1518 bytes, but the more recent standard extended this size to 2000 bytes.

Following the Destination and Source Address fields, [802.3-2008] provides for a variable number of *_tags_* that contain various protocol fields defined by other IEEE standards. The most common of these are the tags used by 802.1p and 802.1q, which provide for virtual LANs and some *_quality-of-service (QoS)_* indicators.

Following the fields discussed so far is the *_data area_* or *_payload_* portion of the frame. This is the area where higher-layer PDUs such as IP datagrams are placed.

The payload sometimes is *_padded_* (appended) with 0 bytes to ensure that the overall frame meets the minimum length requirements.

The final *_Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)_* or *_Frame Check Sequence (FCS)_* field of the Ethernet frame format follows the payload area and provides an integrity check on the frame.

.The Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) frame format contains source and destination addresses, an overloaded _Length/Type_ field, a field for data, and a frame check sequence (a CRC32). Additions to the basic frame format provide for a tag containing a VLAN ID and priority information (802.1p/q) and more recently for an extensible number of tags. The preamble and SFD are used for synchronizing receivers. When half-duplex operation is used with Ethernet running at 100Mb/s or more, additional bits may be appended to short frames as a carrier extension to ensure that the collision detection circuitry operates properly.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-link-layer/ethernet-IEEE-802-3-frame-format.png[Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) frame format,75%,75%]

==== Frame Sizes

There is both a minimum and a maximum size of Ethernet frames.

The minimum is 64 bytes, requiring a minimum data area (payload) length of 48 bytes (no tags).

In cases where the payload is smaller, pad bytes (value 0) are appended to the end of the payload portion to ensure that the minimum length is enforced.

The maximum frame size of conventional Ethernet is 1518 bytes (including the 4-byte CRC and 14-byte header).

This value represents a sort of trade-off: if a frame contains an error (detected on receipt by an incorrect CRC), only 1.5KB need to be retransmitted to repair the problem. On the other hand, the size limits the MTU to not more than 1500 bytes.

In order to send a larger message, multiple frames are required (e.g., 64KB, a common larger size used with TCP/IP networks, would require at least 44 frames).

One way to improve efficiency when moving large amounts of data across an Ethernet would be to make the frame size larger accomplished using Ethernet *_jumbo frames_* [JF], a nonstandard extension to Ethernet that typically allows the frame size to be as large as 9000 bytes. Others make use of so-called *_super jumbo frames_*, which are usually understood to carry more than 9000 bytes.

=== 802.1p/q: Virtual LANs and QoS Tagging

With the growing use of switched Ethernet, it has become possible to interconnect every computer at a site on the same Ethernet LAN.

The advantage of doing this is that any host can directly communicate with any other host, using IP and other network-layer protocols, and requiring little or no administrator configuration.

In addition, broadcast and multicast traffic is distributed to all hosts that may wish to receive it without having to set up special multicast routing protocols.

While these represent some of the advantages of placing many stations on the same Ethernet, having broadcast traffic go to every computer can create an undesirable amount of network traffic when many hosts use broadcast, and there may be some security reasons to disallow complete any-to-any station communication.

To address some of these problems with running large, multiuse switched networks, IEEE extended the 802 LAN standards with a capability called *_virtual LANs (VLANs)_* in a standard known as 802.1q [802.1Q-2005]. Compliant Ethernet switches isolate traffic among hosts to common VLANs.

Note that because of this isolation, two hosts attached to the same switch but operating on different VLANs require a _router_ between them for traffic to flow.

Combination *_switch/router_* devices have been created to address this need, and ultimately the performance of routers has been improved to match the performance of VLAN switching.

Thus, the appeal of VLANs has diminished somewhat, in favor of modern high-performance routers. Nonetheless, they are still used, remain popular in some environments, and are important to understand.

Several methods are used to specify the station-to-VLAN mapping.

* Assigning VLANs by port is a simple and common method, whereby the switch port to which the station is attached is assigned a particular VLAN, so any station so attached becomes a member of the associated VLAN.
* Other options include MAC address- based VLANs that use tables within Ethernet switches to map a station's MAC address to a corresponding VLAN. This can become difficult to manage if stations change their MAC addresses (which they do sometimes, thanks to the behavior of some users).
* IP addresses can also be used as a basis for assigning VLANs.

When stations in different VLANs are attached to the same switch, the switch ensures that traffic does not leak from one VLAN to another, irrespective of the types of Ethernet interfaces being used by the stations.

When multiple VLANs must span multiple switches (*_trunking_*), it becomes necessary to label Ethernet frames with the VLAN to which they belong before they are sent to another switch.

* Support for this capability uses a tag called the *_VLAN tag_* (or header), which holds 12 bits of VLAN identifier (providing for 4096 VLANs, although VLAN 0 and VLAN 4095 are reserved).
* It also contains 3 bits of priority for supporting *_QoS_*, defined in the 802.1p standard.

In many cases, the administrator must configure the ports of the switch to be used to send 802.1p/q frames by enabling trunking on the appropriate ports. To make this job somewhat easier, some switches support a native VLAN option on trunked ports, meaning that untagged frames are by default associated with the native VLAN. Trunking ports are used to interconnect VLAN-capable switches, and other ports are typically used to attach stations. Some switches also support proprietary methods for VLAN trunking (e.g., the Cisco Inter-Switch Link (ISL) protocol).

=== 802.1AX: Link Aggregation (Formerly 802.3ad)

Some systems equipped with multiple network interfaces are capable of *_bonding_* or *_link aggregation_*.

With link aggregation, two or more interfaces are treated as one in order to achieve greater reliability through redundancy or greater performance by splitting (striping) data across multiple interfaces.

The IEEE Amendment 802.1AX [802.1AX-2008] defines the most common method for performing link aggregation and the *_Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)_* to manage such links. LACP uses IEEE 802 frames of a particular format (called LACPDUs).

Using link aggregation on Ethernet switches that support it can be a costeffective alternative to investing in switches with high-speed network ports. If more than one port can be aggregated to provide adequate bandwidth, higherspeed ports may not be required.

Link aggregation may be supported not only on network switches but across multiple *_network interface cards_* (NICs) on a host computer.

Often, aggregated ports must be of the same type, operating in the same mode (i.e., half- or full-duplex).

Linux has the capability to implement link aggregation (bonding) across different types of devices using the following commands:

=== Full Duplex, Power Save, Autonegotiation, and 802.1X Flow Control

When Ethernet was first developed, it operated only in half-duplex mode using a *_shared cable_*. That is, data could be sent only one way at one time, so only one station was sending a frame at any given point in time. With the development of *_switched Ethernet_*, the network was no longer a single piece of shared wire, but instead many sets of links. As a result, multiple pairs of stations could exchange data simultaneously.

In Linux, the _ethtool_ program can be used to query whether full duplex is supported and whether it is being used:

[source,sh,highlight=17]

=== Link-Layer Flow Control

Operating an extended Ethernet LAN in full-duplex mode and across segments of different speeds may require the switches to buffer (store) frames for some period of time.

For example, when multiple stations send to the same destination (called output port contention).

* If the aggregate traffic rate headed for a station exceeds the station's link rate, frames start to be stored in the intermediate switches.

* If this situation persists for a long time, frames may be dropped.

One way to mitigate this situation is to apply *_flow control_* to senders (i.e., slow them down).

Some Ethernet switches (and interfaces) implement flow control by sending special signal frames between switches and NICs.

Flow control signals to the sender that it must slow down its transmission rate, although the specification leaves the details of this to the implementation. Ethernet uses an implementation of flow control called _PAUSE messages_ (also called _PAUSE frames_), specified by 802.3x [802.3-2008].

== Bridges and Switches

The IEEE 802.1d standard specifies the operation of bridges, and thus switches, which are essentially high-performance bridges.

A bridge or switch is used to join multiple physical link-layer networks (e.g., a pair of physical Ethernet segments) or groups of stations.

The most basic setup involves connecting two switches to form an extended LAN.

.A simple extended Ethernet LAN with two switches. Each switch port has a number for reference, and each station (including each switch) has its own MAC address.
image::/assets/tcp-ip-link-layer/switch-extend-lan.png[A simple extended Ethernet LAN with two switches,55%,55%]

Switches A and B in the figure have been interconnected to form an extended LAN.

Note that every network element, including each switch, has its own MAC address.

Nonlocal MAC addresses are *_learned_* by each bridge over time so that eventually every switch knows the port upon which every station can be reached, which are stored in tables (called *_filtering databases_*) within each switch on a per-port (and possibly per-VLAN) basis.

.Filtering databases on switches A and B are created over time (_learned_) by observing the source address on frames seen on switch ports.

When a switch (bridge) is first turned on, its database is empty, so it does not know the location of any stations except itself.

Whenever it receives a frame destined for a station other than itself, it makes a copy for each of the ports other than the one on which the frame arrived and sends a copy of the frame out of each one.

If switches (bridges) never learned the location of stations, every frame would be delivered across every network segment, leading to unwanted overhead.

The learning capability reduces overhead significantly and is a standard feature of switches and bridges.

Today, most operating systems support the capability to bridge between network interfaces, meaning that a standard computer with multiple interfaces can be used as a bridge.

In Windows, for example, interfaces may be bridged together by navigating to the Network Connections menu from the Control Panel, highlighting the interfaces to bridge, right-clicking the mouse, and selecting Bridge Connections.

.In this simple topology, a Linux-based PC is configured to operate as a bridge between the two Ethernet segments it interconnects. As a learning bridge, it accumulates tables of which port should be used to reach the various other systems on the extended LAN.

The simple network uses a Linux-based PC with two Ethernet ports as a bridge. Attached to port 2 is a single station, and the rest of the network is attached to port 1. The following commands enable the bridge:

== Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

PPP stands for the *_Point-to-Point Protocol_* [RFC1661][RFC1662][RFC2153]. It is a popular method for carrying IP datagrams over serial links—from low-speed dial-up modems to high-speed optical links [RFC2615]. It is widely deployed by some DSL service providers, which also use it for assigning Internet system parameters (e.g., initial IP address and domain name server).

PPP should be considered more of a collection of protocols than a single protocol. It supports a basic method to establish a link, called the *_Link Control Protocol (LCP)_*, as well as a family of NCPs, used to establish network-layer links for various kinds of protocols, including IPv4 and IPv6 and possibly non-IP protocols, after LCP has established the basic link. A number of related standards cover control of compression and encryption for PPP, and a number of authentication methods can be employed when a link is brought up.
