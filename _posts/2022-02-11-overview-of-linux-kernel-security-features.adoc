> Editor’s Note: This is a guest post from James Morris, the Linux kernel security subsystem maintainer and manager of the mainline Linux kernel development team at Oracle.

In this article, we’ll take a high-level look at the security features of the Linux kernel. We’ll start with a brief overview of traditional Unix security, and the Tuxrationale for extending that for Linux, then we’ll discuss the Linux security extensions.
