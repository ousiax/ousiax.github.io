The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
== Running Python

* Using the interactive interpreter (shell)
+
```console
$ python3 -q
>>> 2+2
4
>>> quit()
```

* Using python files
+
.test.py
```py
print(2+2)
```
+
```console
$ python3 test.py
4
```

* Using python files with shebang
+
[TIP]
====
In computing, a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)[*shebang*] is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (`#!`) at the beginning of a script. It is also called sharp-exclamation, sha-bang, *hashbang*, pound-bang, or hash-pling.

====
+
.test.py
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print(2+2)
```
+
```console
$ chmod +x test.py
$ ./test.py
4
```

* Executing modules as scripts
+
In Python, `python -m` is a command-line construct used to execute modules as scripts directly from the command line without explicitly writing a separate Python script file (`.py`).
+
```console
$ python3 -m venv --help
usage: venv [-h] [--system-site-packages] [--symlinks | --copies] [--clear] [--upgrade] [--without-pip]
            [--prompt PROMPT] [--upgrade-deps]
            ENV_DIR [ENV_DIR ...]

Creates virtual Python environments in one or more target directories.
. . .
```
+
```console
$ python3 -m webbrowser https://www.google.com
```

== Indentations, comments, and multi-line expressions

* Python uses whitespace indentation (the recommended style, called PEP-8, is to use four spaces), rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.
+
--
** Don't use tabs, or mix tabs and spaces; it messes up the indent count.

** When designing the language that became Python, Guido van Rossum decided that the indentation itself was enough to define a program’s structure, and avoided typing all those parentheses and curly braces. Python is unusual in this use of white space to define program structure.
--
+
```py
disaster = True
if disaster:
    print("Woe!")
else:
    print("Whee!")
```

** As one special case here, the body of a compound statement can instead appear on the same line as the header in Python, after the colon:
+
```py
if x > y: print(x)  # # Simple statement on header line
```

* In Python, the general rule is that the end of a line automatically terminates the statement that appears on that line.
+
```py
x = 1  # x = 1;
```
+
Although normally appearing one per line, it is possible to squeeze more than one statement onto a single line in Python by separating them with semicolons:
+
```py
a = 1; b = 2; print(a + b) # Three statements on one line
```

* Python allows to write expressions that span multiple lines within certain delimiters.

** In older versions of Python (pre-3.0), the backslash character (`\`) at the end of a line was used to indicate that the line continued on the next line, which  is no longer required in modern Python (versions 3.0 and above).
+
```py
# Example in older Python (error-prone, not recommended)
long_expression = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \
                  6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)
```

** In modern Python, avoid using the continuation character (`\`) for line continuation, and utilize parentheses (`()`), brackets (`[]`), or braces (`[]`) for readability and structure in multi-line expressions.
+
```py
# Parentheses for complex calculations
long_calculation = (a * b +
                    c) * (d /
                          e - f)

# Brackets for multi-line lists or data structures
data = [
    "item1",
    "item2 with a longer description",
    "item3"
]

# Braces for multi-line dictionaries
person_info = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking"]
}
```
* A comment is marked by using the `#` (names: _hash_, _sharp_, _pound_, or or the sinister-sounding _octothorpe_) character; everything from that point on to the end of the current line is part of the comment.
+
```py
# 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day
seconds_per_day = 86400
```
+
```py
seconds_per_day = 86400 # 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day
```
+
```py
# Python does NOT
# have a multiline comment.
print("No comment: quotes make the # harmless.")
```

== Types

```txt
False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not
```

* Python is a dynamically, strongly typed and garbage-collected programming language.
+
--
* In a dynamically typed language, the data type of a variable is NOT explicitly declared at the time of definition, and is determined at runtime.
+
```py
age = 30  # age is an integer (no need to declare the data type explicitly)
age = "thirty"  # age is now a string
```

* In a statically typed language, the data type of a variable MUST be declared at compile time and the compiler ensures type compatibility throughout the code.
+
```java
// In Java, declare the type of a variable before assigning a value.
int age = 30;  // age is declared as an integer
age = "thirty";  // error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
```

* In a strongly typed language, the data type of a variable MUST be declared at the time of definition, and the compiler or interpreter enforces type safety.

* In Python, everything is ultimately an object, even data types like integers and strings, that has associated methods and attributes. During runtime, Python checks if the methods or attributes involved are compatible with the object's type.
+
```py
# Like dynamic languages, Python infers types based on assigned values.
name = "Alice"  # name is a string
name + 10  # This would cause a TypeError in Python (mixing string and number)
```
+
[TIP]
====
In computer programming, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing[duck typing] is an application of the duck test—"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose.

```
--

* https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/[Type hints] (or type annotations): `variable_name: type`, `def func(argument: type) \-> type`
+
```py
age: int = 30
pi: float = 3.14159
```
+
```py
def greet(name: str) -> str:
  """Greets the provided name."""
  return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

* In Python, variables are NOT places, just names, and a name is a _reference_ to an object rather than the object itself, which is a chunk of data that contains at least a _type_, a unique _id_, a _value_, and a _reference count_.
+
```py
type(5.20)  # <class 'float'>
id(5.20)  # 140683748269744
x = y = z = 0  # More than one variable name can be assigned a value at the same time
sys.getrefcount(x)  # 1000000591
del y
sys.getrefcount(x)  # 1000000590
del z
sys.getrefcount(x)  # 1000000589
```

* A _class_ is the definition of an object, and "class" and "type" mean pretty much the same thing.
+
```py
type(7)  # <class 'int'>
type(7) == int  # True
isinstance(7, int)  # True
```

* Strings, tuples and lists are common built-in sequences, which are zero-based indexing and ordered collections that can store elements of any data types, except strings, which are sequences of characters themselves.
+
```py
# iteration
for item in ['meow', 'bark', 'moo']:
    print(item)
```
+
```py
# enumeration
for index, item in enumerate(['meow', 'bark', 'moo']):
    print(f'Index: {index}, Item: {item}')
```
+
```py
# comparisons
('meow', 'bark', 'moo') == ('meow', 'bark', 'moo')  # True
('meow', 'bark', 'moo') >= ('meow', 'bark')  # True
('meow', 'bark', 'moo') > ('meow', 'bark')  # True
```
+
```py
# `+`, `*`
('cat',) + ('dog', 'cattle')  # ('cat', 'dog', 'cattle')
('bark',) * 3  # ('bark', 'bark', 'bark')
```
+
```py
# unpacking
cat, dog, cattle = ('meow', 'bark', 'moo')
```
+
```py
# testing with `in`
'c' in 'cat'  # True
'meow' in ['cat', 'cattle', 'dog']  # False
```
+
```py
# indexing, and slicing a shallow copy subsequence:
s = 'hello!'  # len(S) is 6
# S[-7], S[6]  # IndexError: string index out of range

# The slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)]:
#    slice(stop)
#    slice(start, stop[, step])
#
# [:] extracts the entire sequence from start to end.
# [ start :] specifies from the start offset to the end.
# [: end ] specifies from the beginning to the end offset minus 1.
# [ start : end ] indicates from the start offset to the end offset minus 1.
# [ start : end : step ] extracts from the start offset to the end offset minus 1, skipping characters by step.

# Indexing (S[i]) fetches components at offsets:
#   The first item is at offset 0.
#   Negative indexes mean to count backward from the end or right.
#     Technically, a negative offset is added to the length of a sequence to derive a positive offset.
#   S[0] fetches the first item.
#   S[−2] fetches the second item from the end (like S[len(S)−2]).
#
# Slicing(S[i:j]) extracts contiguous sections of sequences:
#   The upper bound is noninclusive.
#   Slice boundaries default to 0 and the sequence length, if omitted.
#   S[1:3] fetches items at offsets 1 up to but not including 3.
#   S[1:] fetches items at offset 1 through the end(the sequence length).
#   S[:3] fetches items at offset 0 up to but not including 3.
#   S[:−1] fetches items at offset 0 up to but not including the last item.
#   S[:] fetches items at offsets 0 through the end—making a top-level copy of S.
#
# Extended slicing (S[i:j:k]) accepts a step ( or stride) k, which defaults to + 1:
#   Allows for skipping items and reversing order(using a negative stride).

s[:], s[0:6], s[:6], s[:6:], s[0:6:], s[0:6:1]  # ('hello!', 'hello!', 'hello!', 'hello!', 'hello!', 'hello!')
s[::-1]  # '!olleh'
len(s), s[-1], s[len(s)-1], s[-len(s)], s[0]  # (6, '!', '!', 'h', 'h')
```

* In Python, truthiness and falsiness are used to check a value in a Boolean context:

** Truthy: Values that evaluate to `True`, which includes most non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, lists, dictionaries, and many objects.

** Falsy: Values that evaluate to `False`, which include `False`, zero numbers (`0`, `0.0`), empty strings (`""`), lists (`[]`), and tuples (`()`), and `None`.

* In Python, the logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` are used to combine Boolean values (`True`/`False`) or expressions that evaluate to Boolean values.
+
```py
letter = 'o'
if letter == 'a' or letter == 'e' or letter == 'i' or letter == 'o' or letter == 'u':
    print(letter, 'is a vowel')
else:
    print(letter, 'is not a vowel')
```

* Python provides bit-level integer operators, similar to those in the C language.
+
```py
x = 5  # 0b0101
y = 1  # 0b0001

print(f"0b{(x & y):04b}")  # and
# 0b0001
print(f"0b{(x | y):04b}")  # or
# 0b0101
print(f"0b{(x ^ y):04b}")  # exclusive or
# 0b0100
print(f'0b{~x:04b}')  # flip bits
# 0b-110
print(f'0b{(x << 1):04b}')  # left shift
# 0b1010
print(f'0b{(x >> 1):04b}')  # right shift
# 0b0010
```

* Test for equality: `==` and `is`
+
```py
# The `==` operator tests value equivalence.
#   Python performs an equivalence test, comparing all nested objects recursively.
#
# The `is` operator tests object identity.
#   Python tests whether the two are really the same object (i.e., live at the same address in memory).
S1 = 'spam'
S2 = 'spam'
S1 == S2, S1 is S2
(True, True)
```

== Strings, bytes and bytearray

In Python 3.X there are three string types: `str` is used for Unicode text (including ASCII), `bytes` is used for binary data (including encoded text), and `bytearray` is a mutable variant of bytes. Files work in two modes: _text_, which represents content as `str` and implements Unicode encodings, and `binary`, which deals in raw bytes and does no data translation.

* UTF-8 is the standard text encoding in Python, Linux, and HTML.
+
Ken Thompson and Rob Pike, whose names will be familiar to Unix developers, designed the UTF-8 dynamic encoding scheme one night on a placemat in a New Jersey diner. It uses one to four bytes per Unicode character:
+
--
* One byte for ASCII
* Two bytes for most Latin-derived (but not Cyrillic) languages
* Three bytes for the rest of the basic multilingual plane
* Four bytes for the rest, including some Asian languages and symbols
--
+
```py
cafe = 'café'

# len() function on string counts Unicode characters, not bytes:
len(cafe)  # 4

cafe_bytes = cafe.encode()  # b'caf\xc3\xa9'

# len() returns the number of bytes:
len(cafe_bytes)  # 5

cafe_text = cafe_bytes.decode()  # 'café'
```

* Strings are created by enclosing characters in matching single, double, or triple quotes:
+
```py
'Snap'
"Crackle"
"'Nay!' said the naysayer. 'Neigh?' said the horse."
'The rare double quote in captivity: ".'
'''Boom!'''
"""Eek!"""
```

* Triple quotes are very useful to create multiline strings, like this classic poem from Edward Lear:
+
```py
poem = '''There was a Young Lady of Norway,
    Who casually sat in a doorway;
    When the door squeezed her flat,
    She exclaimed, "What of that?"
    This courageous Young Lady of Norway.'''
print(poem)
```
+
```console
There was a Young Lady of Norway,
    Who casually sat in a doorway;
    When the door squeezed her flat,
    She exclaimed, "What of that?"
    This courageous Young Lady of Norway.
```
+
```py
# the line ending characters, and leading or trailing spaces are preserved as below:
'There was a Young Lady of Norway,\n    Who casually sat in a doorway;\n    When the door squeezed her flat,\n    She exclaimed, "What of that?"\n    This courageous Young Lady of Norway.'
```

* Escape with `\`, combine by using `+`, duplicate with `*`
+
```py
hi = 'Na ' 'Na ' 'Na ' 'Na ' \ # literal strings (not string variables) just one after the other
    + 'Hey ' * 4 \
    + '\\' + '\t' + 'Goodbye.'
print(hi)  # Na Na Na Na Hey Hey Hey Hey \	Goodbye.
```

* Python has a few special types of strings, indicated by a letter before the first quote.

** `f` or `F` starts an _f-string_, used for formatting.
+
```py
thing = 'wereduck'
place = 'werepond'
print(f'The {thing} is in the {place}')  # 'The wereduck is in the werepond'
```

** `r` or `R` starts a raw string, used to prevent escape sequences in the string.
+
```py
info = r'Type a \n to get a new line'  # info = 'Type a \\n to get a new line'
```
+
```py
# raw string does not undo any real (not `\n`) newlines:
poem = r'''Boys and girls, come out to play.
The moon doth shine as bright as day.'''  # 'Boys and girls, come out to play.\nThe moon doth shine as bright as day.'
print(poem)
```
+
```console
Boys and girls, come out to play.
The moon doth shine as bright as day.
```

** `fr` (or `FR`, `Fr`, or `fR`), the combination, that starts a raw f-string.
+
```py
hello = 'Hello'
world = '世界'
print(fr'{hello}, {world}!')  # Hello, 世界!
```

** `u` starts a Unicode string, which is the same as a plain string.
+
TIP: Python 3 strings are Unicode character sequences, not byte arrays.
+
```py
hi = u'Hello, 世界!'  # same as: hi = 'Hello, 世界!'
```

** `b` starts a value of type bytes.
+
```py
ip = [20, 205, 243, 166]
bytes(ip)  # b'\x14\xcd\xf3\xa6'
```

* Python has three ways of formatting strings.
+
```py
actor = 'Richard Gere'
cat = 'Chester'
weight = 28
```
+
```py
# old style (supported in Python 2 and 3): format_string % data
'My wife\'s favorite actor is %s' % actor  # "My wife's favorite actor is Richard Gere"
'Our cat %s weighs %d pounds' % (cat, weight)  # 'Our cat Chester weighs 28 pounds'
'Our cat %(cat)s weighs %(weight)d pounds' % {'cat': cat, 'weight': weight}  # dictionary-based expressions
```
+
```py
# new style (Python 2.6 and up): format_string.format(data)
'{0}, {1} and {2}'.format('spam', 'ham', 'eggs')  # By position
'{motto}, {pork} and {food}'.format(motto='spam', pork='ham', food='eggs')  # By keyword
'{motto}, {0} and {food}'.format('ham', motto='spam', food='eggs')  # By both
'{}, {} and {}'.format('spam', 'ham', 'eggs')  # By relative position
# 'spam, ham and eggs'
```
+
```py
# f-strings (Python 3.6 and up): f, F
f'Our cat {cat} weighs {weight} pounds'  # 'Our cat Chester weighs 28 pounds'
```

* Python 3 introduced the following sequences of eight-bit integers, with possible values from 0 to 255, in two types:
+
--
* `bytes` is immutable, like a tuple of bytes

* `bytearray` is mutable, like a list of bytes

Endian order refers to the byte order used to store multi-byte values (like integers, floats) in computer memory.

* Big-Endian: In big-endian order, the most significant byte (MSB) of a multi-byte value is stored at the beginning (lower memory address) of the allocated space. The remaining bytes follow in decreasing order of significance.

* Little-Endian: In little-endian order, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the beginning (lower memory address), followed by bytes of increasing significance.

```py
blist = [1, 2, 3, 255]

the_bytes = bytes(blist)
print(the_bytes)
# b'\x01\x02\x03\xff'

the_byte_array = bytearray(blist)
print(the_byte_array)
# bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\xff')

the_bytes[0] = 127  # TypeError: 'bytes' object does not support item assignment

the_byte_array[0] = 127

the_byte_array[1] = 256  # ValueError: byte must be in range(0, 256)

the_bytes = bytes(range(0, 256))
for i in range(0, len(the_bytes), 16):
    end_index = min(i+16, len(the_bytes))
    print(the_bytes[i:end_index])
# b'\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\t\n\x0b\x0c\r\x0e\x0f'
# b'\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f'

== If, while, and for

* In Python (version 3.8 and above), the walrus operator (`:=`, formally known as the assignment expression operator) combines assignment and expression evaluation in a single line.
+
```py
tweet_limit = 280
tweet_string = "Blah" * 50
if diff := tweet_limit - len(tweet_string) >= 0:  # walrus operator
    print("A fitting tweet")
else:
    print("Went over by", abs(diff))
```

* Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else`:
+
```py
color = "mauve"
if color == "red":
    print("It's a tomato")
elif color == "green":
    print("It's a green pepper")
else:
    print("I've never heard of the color", color)
```

* The `if`/`else` ternary expression:
+
```py
# Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false.
# A = Y if X else Z  # equivalent to `((X and Y) or Z)`
A = 't' if 'spam' else 'f'  # (('spam' and 't') or 'f')
A  # 't'
```

* Dictionary-based multiway branching:
+
```py
# Handling switch defaults
branch = {'spam': 1.25,
          'ham': 1.99,
          'eggs': 0.99}
print(branch.get('spam', 'Bad choice'))  # 1.25
print(branch.get('bacon', 'Bad choice'))  # Bad choice
# membership test in an if statement can have the same default effect:
choice = 'bacon'
if choice in branch:
    print(branch[choice])
else:
    print('Bad choice')  # Bad choice

# handle defaults by catching and handling the exceptions they'd otherwise trigger:
try:
    print(branch[choice])
except KeyError:
    print('Bad choice')

# Handling larger actions
branch = {'spam': lambda: ...,  # A table of callable function objects
          'ham': function,
          'eggs': lambda: ...}
branch.get(choice, default)()
```

* Repeat with `while`, and `break`, `continue`, and `else`:
+
```py
while True:
    value = input("Integer, please [q to quit]: ")
    if value == 'q':  # quit
        break
    number = int(value)
    if number % 2 == 0:  # an even number
        continue
    print(number, "squared is", number*number)
```
+
```py
while x:  # Exit when x empty
    if match(x[0]):  # Value at front?
        print('Ni')
        break  # Exit, go around else
    x = x[1:]  # Slice off front and repeat
else:  # break not called
    print('Not found')  # Only here if exhausted x
```

* Iterate with `for`/`in`, and `break`, `continue` and `else`:
+
```py
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'u':
        continue
    print(letter)
```
+
```py
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'x':
        print("Eek! An 'x'!")
        break
    print(letter)
else:  # break not called
    print("No 'x' in there.")
```

```py
# counter loops: range

```

== Tuples and lists

* *Tuples* are built-in immutable sequences.
+
```py
# to make a tuple with one or more elements, follow each element with a comma (`,`):
'cat',  # ('cat',)
'cat', 'dog', 'cattle'  # ('cat', 'dog', 'cattle')

# to make an empty tuple, using `()`, or `tuple()`:
()  # ()
tuple()  # ()

# the comma is required to make a tuple
('cat')  # 'cat'

# the parentheses is not required, but could make the tuple more visible
('cat',)  # ('cat',)
('cat', 'dog', 'cattle')  # ('cat', 'dog', 'cattle')

# for cases in which commas might also have another use, the parentheses is needed
type('cat',)  # <class 'str'>
type(('cat',))  # <class 'tuple'>

# tuple()
tuple('cat')  # ('c', 'a', 't')

# zip()
for x in zip([1, 2, 8], [1, 4, 9], ('cat', 'dog', 'cattle', 'chicken')):
     print(x)
# (1, 1, 'cat')
# (2, 4, 'dog')
# (8, 9, 'cattle')

# generator expression
nums = tuple(range(10))  # (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
(x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0)  # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7fcd7069b920>
```
+
```py
# named tuples are a tuple/class/dictionary hybrid.
from collections import namedtuple  # import extension type
Rec = namedtuple('Rec', ['name', 'age', 'jobs'])  # make a generated class
bob = Rec('Bob', age=40.5, jobs=['dev', 'mgr'])  # a named-tuple record
print(bob)  # Rec(name='Bob', age=40.5, jobs=['dev', 'mgr'])

bob[0], bob[2]  # access by position
('Bob', ['dev', 'mgr'])

bob.name, bob.jobs  # access by attribute
('Bob', ['dev', 'mgr'])

# converting to a dictionary supports key-based behavior when needed:
O = bob._asdict()  # dictionary-like form
O['name'], O['jobs']  # access by key too
('Bob', ['dev', 'mgr'])
O
# OrderedDict([('name', 'Bob'), ('age', 40.5), ('jobs', ['dev', 'mgr'])])
```

* *Lists* are built-in mutable sequences.
+
```py
# create with `[]` or `list()`
[]  # []
['meow', 'bark', 'moo']  # ['meow', 'bark', 'moo']
[('cat', 'meow'), 'bark', 'moo']  # [('cat', 'meow'), 'bark', 'moo']

# index, and slice assignment
L = ['spam', 'Spam', 'SPAM!']
# index assignment
L[1] = 'eggs'  # ['spam', 'eggs', 'SPAM!']
# slice assignment: delete+insert
L[0:2] = ['eat', 'more']  # ['eat', 'more', 'SPAM!']

# del, remove(), pop(), clear()
farm = ['cat', 'dog', 'cattle', 'chicken', 'duck']

del farm[-1]
# ['cat', 'dog', 'cattle', 'chicken']

farm.remove('dog')
# ['cat', 'cattle', 'chicken']

farm.pop()  # 'chicken'

farm.clear()
# []

# sort() and sorted()
farm = ['cat', 'dog', 'cattle']

# a sorted copy
sorted(farm)  # ['cat', 'cattle', 'dog']
print(farm)  # ['cat', 'dog', 'cattle']

# sorting in-place 
farm.sort()
print(farm)  # ['cat', 'cattle', 'dog']

# shallow copy: any changes made to the elements within the original list will also be reflected in the copy.
a = [['cat', 'meow'], ['dog', 'bark']]
c = a[:]
b = a.copy()  # equivalent to list slicing ([:] )but might be slightly less efficient.
d = list(c)

# deep copy: changes to elements within the original list won't affect the copy (and vice versa) because they point to different objects in memory.
import copy
e = copy.deepcopy(a)

a[0][1] = 'moo'
a  # [['cat', 'moo'], ['dog', 'bark']]
b  # [['cat', 'moo'], ['dog', 'bark']]
c  # [['cat', 'moo'], ['dog', 'bark']]
d  # [['cat', 'moo'], ['dog', 'bark']]

e  # [['cat', 'meow'], ['dog', 'bark']]

# list comprehensions: [expression for item in iterable]
even_numbers = [2 * num for num in range(5)]
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
# list comprehensions: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
odd_numbers = [num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 1]
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

== Dictionaries and sets

TIP: In Python, keys in dictionaries (dict) and elements in sets must be of immutable, or hashable data types.

*Dictionaries*

```py
# `{}`
{}  # {}
{'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}

# dict(): keyword argument names need to be legal variable names (no spaces, no reserved words)
dict(cat='meow', dog='bark')  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}

# dict(): zipping together sequences of keys and values into a dictionary
dict([['cat', 'meow'], ['dog', 'bark']])  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}

# [key], get()
animals = {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}
animals['cattle'] = 'moo'  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark', 'cattle': 'moo'}
animals['cat']  # 'meow'
animals['sheep']  # KeyError: 'sheep'
animals.get('sheep')  # None
animals.get('sheep', 'baa')  # 'baa'

# testing
animals = {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}
'cat' in animals  # True
'sheep' in animals  # False
animals['sheep'] if 'sheep' in animals else 'oops!'  # 'oops!'

animals.values()  # dict_values(['meow', 'bark', 'moo'])
animals.items()  # dict_items([('cat', 'meow'), ('dog', 'bark'), ('cattle', 'moo')])
len(animals)  # 3

# `**`, update()
{**{'cat': 'meow'}, **{'dog': 'bark'}}  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}
animals = {'cat': 'meow'}
animals.update({'dog': 'bark'})  # {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark'}

# del, pop(), clear()

animals.clear()
# {}

# iterations
animals = {'cat': 'meow', 'dog': 'bark', 'cattle': 'moo'}
for key in animals:  # for key in animals.keys()
    print(f'{key} => {animals[key]}', end='\t')
# cat => meow	dog => bark	cattle => moo

# dictionary comprehensions: {key_expression : value_expression for expression in iterable}
word = 'letters'
letter_counts = {letter: word.count(letter) for letter in word}
# {'l': 1, 'e': 2, 't': 2, 'r': 1, 's': 1}

# dictionary comprehensions: {key_expression : value_expression for expression in iterable if condition}
vowels = 'aeiou'

                for letter in set(word) if letter in vowels}
# {'i': 1, 'o': 4, 'a': 2, 'e': 1}
```

*Sets*

```py
# `{}`, set(), frozenset()
{}  # <class 'dict'>

# set comprehensions: { expression for expression in iterable }
{num for num in range(10)}  # {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
# set comprehensions: { expression for expression in iterable if condition }
{num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0}  # {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
```

== Iterations and comprehensions

The terms "iterable" and "iterator" are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to an object that supports iteration in general. For clarity, using the term _iterable_ to refer to an object that supports the `iter` call, and _iterator_ to refer to an object returned by an _iterable_ on `iter` that supports the `next(I)` call.

Any object with a `++__next__++` method to advance to a next result, which raises `StopIteration` at the end of the series of results, is considered an _iterator_, that may also be stepped through with a `for` loop or other iteration tool, because all iteration tools normally work internally by calling `++__next__++` on each iteration and catching the `StopIteration` exception to determine when to exit.

```py
print(open('script2.py').read())
# import sys
# print(sys.path)
# x = 2
# print(x**32)

f = open('script2.py')
f.__next__()
# 'import sys\n'
f.__next__()
# 'print(sys.path)\n'
f.__next__()
# 'x = 2\n'
f.__next__()
# 'print(x**32)\n'
f.__next__()
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# StopIteration
```

```py
# manual iteration: what for loops usually do
with open('script2.py', 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as fi:
    while True:
        try:
            # To simplify manual iteration code, Python 3.X also provides a built-in function, next,
            # that automatically calls an object’s __next__ method.
            line = fi.__next__()  # same as: line = next(fi)
            print(line, end='')
        except StopIteration:
            break
```

```py
for line in open('script2.py'):  # use file iterators to read by lines
    print(line.upper(), end='')  # calls __next__, catches StopIteration
```

When the `for` loop begins, it first uses the iteration protocol to obtain an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the `iter` built-in function; the object returned by `iter` in turn has the required `next` method. The `iter` function internally runs the `++__iter__++` method, much like `next` and `++__next__++`.

The Python iteration protocol, used by for loops, comprehensions, maps, and more, and supported by files, lists, dictionaries, generators, and more.

* The _iterable_ object you request iteration for, whose `++__iter__++` is run by `iter`.

* The _iterator_ object returned by the iterable that actually produces values during the iteration, whose `++__next__++` is run by `next` and raises `StopIteration` when finished producing results.
+
```py
L = [1, 2, 3]  # iterable
I = iter(L)  # iterator
next(I)
# 1
next(I)
# 2
next(I)
# 3
next(I)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# StopIteration
```

Iteration contexts in Python include the `for` loop; `list` comprehensions; the `map` built-in function; the `in` membership test expression; and the built-in functions `sorted`, `sum`, `any`, and `all`, and also includes the `list` and `tuple` built-ins, string `join` methods, and sequence assignments, all of which use the iteration protocol to step across iterable objects one item at a time.

Technically speaking, list comprehensions are never really required because a list of expression results can be always built up manually with for loops, however, list comprehensions might run much faster than manual for loop statements (often roughly twice as fast) because their iterations are performed at C language speed inside the interpreter, rather than with manual Python code.

```py
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
res = []
for x in L:
    res.append(x+10)
print(res)  # [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
```

```py
res2 = [x + 10 for x in L]
print(res2)  # [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
```

```py
# filter clauses: if
[line.rstrip() for line in open('script2.py') if line[0] == 'p']
```

```py
# nested loops: for
[x + y for x in 'abc' for y in 'lmn']
```

== Files and directories

A _file_ is a sequence of bytes, stored in some _filesystem_, and accessed by a _filename_. A _directory_ (or _folder_) is a collection of files, and possibly other directories.

* _Text files_ represent content as normal `str` strings, perform Unicode encoding and decoding automatically, and perform end-of-line translation by default.

* _Binary files_ represent content as a special `bytes` string type and allow programs to access file content unaltered.

* `open(filename, mode)`: Opens a file in the specified mode, and returns a file object used for reading or writing data.

** `file.read(size)`: Read a specified number of characters (or bytes) from the file (or all remaining bytes if no size is provided).

** `file.readline()`: Read a single line from the file.

** `file.readlines()`: Read all lines from the file into a list.

** `for line in open('data'): use line`: File iterators read line by line.

** `file.write(data)`: Write a string of characters (or bytes) data to the file.

** `file.writelines(aList)`: Write all line strings in a list into file.

** `file.flush()`: Flush output buffer to disk without closing.

** `file.seek(N)`: Change file position to offset `N` for next operation.

** `mode` (optional): a string specifies how the file will be opened, which determines the access permissions and how newline characters (for text files) are handled.
+
--
** `r` (read): Opens the file for reading. The file must exist, or an error will be raised.
** `w` (write): Opens the file for writing. An existing file will be truncated (emptied) before writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
** `a` (append): Opens the file for appending. New data will be written to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
** `x` (exclusive creation): Attempts to create a new file. If the file already exists, an error will be raised.
** `r+` (read and write): Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
** `w+` (read and write): Opens the file for both reading and writing. An existing file will be truncated before any operations. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
** `a+` (append and read): Opens the file for both appending and reading. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

** By default, Python opens files in text mode (`t`), that handles newline characters differently based on the operating system (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix/Linux).

** The binary mode (`b`) can be specified  by appending it to any mode (e.g., `rb`, `wb`), that treats the file as a raw stream of bytes without newline conversion.

** Python 3 offers a universal newline mode (`U`) that attempts to handle various newline conventions consistently (consult documentation for details).

== Functions

```py
# Function-related statements and expressions

# call expressions
myfunc('spam', 'eggs', meat=ham, *rest)

# def
def printer(messge):
    print('Hello ' + message)

# return
def adder(a, b=1, *c):
    return a + b + c[0]

# global
x = 'old'
def changer():
    global x; x = 'new'

# nonlocal (3.X)
def outer():
    x = 'old'
    def changer():
        nonlocal x; x = 'new'

# yield
def squares(x):
  for i in range(x): yield i ** 2

# lambda
funcs = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: x**3]
```

```py
# pass
def do_nothing():
    pass  # NOOP
do_nothing()
```

[TIP]
====
Python 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as `...` (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the `pass` statement, especially for code to be filled in later—a sort of Python "TBD":

```py
def func1():
    ... # Alternative to pass
def func2():
    ...
func1() # Does nothing if called
```

Ellipses can also appear on the same line as a statement header and may be used to initialize variable names if no specific type is required:

```py
def func1(): ... # Works on same line too
def func2(): ...
```

```py
X = ... # Alternative to None
X  # Ellipsis
```

This notation is new in Python 3.X—and goes well beyond the original intent of `...` in slicing extensions—so time will tell if it becomes widespread enough to challenge `pass` and `None` in these roles.
====

* `def` is an executable statement to create a new function object and assigns it to a name at runtime, and can appear anywhere a statement can—even nested in other statements.

* `lambda` is an expression, not a statement, for coding simple functions, and its body is a single expression, not a block of statements.

* `return` sends a result object back to the caller.

* `yield` sends a result object back to the caller, but remembers where it left off, to produce a series of results over time.

* `global` declares module-level variables that are to be assigned, that tells Python that a function plans to change one or more global names—that is, names that live in the enclosing module’s scope (namespace).
+
```py
X = 88  # Global X

def func():
    global X
    X = 99  # Global X: outside def

func()
print(X)  # Prints 99
```

* `nonlocal` declares enclosing function variables that are to be assigned, that is declaring the enclosing scopes’ names in a nonlocal statement enables nested functions to assign and thus change such names as well.
+
```py
def tester(start):
    state = start  # Each call gets its own state

    def nested(label):
        nonlocal state  # Remembers state in enclosing scope
        print(label, state)
        state += 1  # Allowed to change it if nonlocal
    return nested

# Increments state on each call
F = tester(0)
F('spam')  # spam 0
F('ham')   # ham 1
F('eggs')  # eggs 2
```

* Arguments are *passed by assignment* (object reference), and are passed by position, unless saying otherwise.

** Values passed in a function call match argument names in a function’s definition from left to right by default.

** Function calls can also pass arguments by name with `name=value` keyword syntax, and unpack arbitrarily many arguments to send with `+++*args+++` and `+++**kargs+++` starred-argument notation.

** Function definitions use the same two forms to specify argument defaults, and collect arbitrarily many arguments received.

* Arguments, return values, and variables are not declared, and there are no type constraints on functions, and a single function can often be applied to a variety of object types—any objects that sport a compatible interface (methods and expressions) will do, regardless of their specific types.


```py
# None
def whatis(thing):  # def whatis(thing: any) -> None:
    if thing is None:
        print(thing, "is None")
    elif thing:
        print(thing, "is True")

whatis(None)  # None is None
```

```py
# docstring
def echo(anything):
    'echo returns its input argument'
    return anything

print(echo.__doc__)  # 'echo returns its input argument'
help(echo)
```

=== Namespaces

When talking about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term _scope_ refers to a _namespace_—a place where names live. Python’s name-resolution scheme is sometimes called the _LEGB rule_, after the scope names:

* When using an unqualified name inside a function, Python searches up to four scopes—the local (_L_) scope, then the local scopes of any enclosing (_E_) ``def``s and ``lambda``s, then the global (_G_) scope, and then the built-in (_B_) scope—and stops at the first place the name is found. If the name is not found during this search, Python reports an error.

* When assigning a name in a function (instead of just referring to it in an expression), Python always creates or changes the name in the local scope, unless it’s declared to be `global` or `nonlocal` in that function.

* When assigning a name outside any function (i.e., at the top level of a module file, or at the interactive prompt), the local scope is the same as the global scope—the module’s namespace.

```py
def tester(start):
    def nested(label):
        nonlocal state  # Nonlocals must already exist in enclosing def!
        state = 0
        print(label, state)
    return nested
# SyntaxError: no binding for nonlocal 'state' found


def tester(start):
    def nested(label):
        global state  # Globals don't have to exist yet when declared
        state = 0  # This creates the name in the module now
        print(label, state)
    return nested
```

Python provides two functions to access the contents of the namespaces:

* `locals()` returns a dictionary of the contents of the local namespace.

* `globals()` returns a dictionary of the contents of the global namespace.

```py
a = 5.21

def print_global_a():
 global a  # the global keyword: explicit is better than implicit
 print(a)

print_global_a()
# 5.21

def print_locals_globals():
    a: int = 0
    b: float = 3.14
    print(locals())
    print(globals())

print_locals_globals()
# {'a': 0, 'b': 3.14}
# {'__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None, '__package__': None, '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, '__spec__': None, '__annotations__': {}, '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>, 'print_locals': <function print_locals at 0x7fab761ade40>, 'print_globals': <function print_globals at 0x7fab761adee0>, 'print_locals_globals': <function print_locals_globals at 0x7fab761bbba0>, 'a': 5.21}
```

* `vars()` without arguments, equivalent to `locals()`.
+
```py
print(vars())
# {'__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None, '__package__': None, '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, '__spec__': None, '__annotations__': {}, '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>}
```

```py
# In a function header, arguments must appear in this order: any normal arguments (name); followed
# by any default arguments (name=value); followed by the *name (or * in 3.X) form; followed by any
# name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form.

# In Python 3.X only, argument names in a function header can also have annotation values, specified
# as name:value (or name:value=default when defaults are present). The function itself can also have
# an annotation value, given as def f()->value.

# In a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments (value); followed
# by a combination of any keyword arguments (name=value) and the *iterable form; followed by the
# **dict form.

# In both the call and header, the **args form must appear last if present.

# The steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before assignment can roughly be
# described as follows:
#   1. Assign nonkeyword arguments by position.
#   2. Assign keyword arguments by matching names.
#   3. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple.
#   4. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary.
#   5. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header.

```

=== Attributes

In Python, functions are objects, which may be assigned to other names, passed to other functions, embedded in data structures, returned from one function to another, and more, as if they were simple numbers or strings.

```py
# functions are first-class citizens
def answer():
    print(42)

def run_sth(func):
    func()

run_sth(answer)  # 42

# inner functions
def outer(a, b):
    def inner(c, d):
        return c+d
    return inner(a, b)
```

Function objects are not limited to the system-defined attributes, but also can be attached arbitrary user-defined attributes.

```py
def func(): ...

dir(func)  # ['__annotations__', '__code__', '__name__', ...]

func.count = 0
func.count += 1
func.count  # 1

func.handles = 'Button-Press'
func.handles  # 'Button-Press'
```

=== Annotations

In Python 3.X, it’s also possible to attach annotation information—arbitrary user-defined data about a function’s arguments and result—to a function object, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s `+++__annotations__+++` attribute for use by other tools.

```py
def func(a: 'spam', b: (1, 10), c: float) -> int: return a + b + c
func.__annotations__  # {'a': 'spam', 'b': (1, 10), 'c': <class 'float'>, 'return': <class 'int'>}
```

=== Lambda

Python provides a `lambda` expression form that generates anonymous (i.e., unnamed) function objects. Its general form is the keyword `lambda`, followed by one or more arguments (exactly like the arguments list enclosed in parentheses in a `def` header), followed by an expression after a colon:

```py
lambda argument1, argument2,... argumentN : expression using arguments
```

```py
# defs and lambdas do the same sort of work:
def func(x, y, z): return x + y + z
func(2, 3, 4)  # 9
f = func
f(2, 3, 4)  # 9

g = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
g(2, 3, 4)  # 9

# defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def:
x = (lambda a="fee", b="fie", c="foe": a + b + c)
x("wee")  # 'weefiefoe'
```

```py
# lambda is also commonly used to code jump tables, which are lists or dictionaries of
# actions to be performed on demand. For example:
L = [lambda x: x ** 2,  # Inline function definition
     lambda x: x ** 3,
     lambda x: x ** 4]  # A list of three callable functions
for f in L:
    print(f(2))  # Prints 4, 8, 16
print(L[0](3))  # Prints 9

key = 'got'
actions = {
    'already': (lambda: 2 + 2),
    'got': (lambda: 2 * 4),
    'one': (lambda: 2 ** 6),
}
actions[key]()  # 8
```

```py
from functools import reduce
nums = range(10)  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# map: mapping functions over iterables
list(map(lambda x: x+1, nums))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# filter: selecting items in iterables
list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# reduce: combining items in iterables
reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, nums)  # 45
```

### Closures

```py
def maker(N):
    def action(X):  # make and return action
        return X ** N  # action retains N from enclosing scope
    return action

f = maker(2)
f  # <function maker.<locals>.action at 0x7faba988f240>
f(3)  # 9
f(4)  # 16
g = maker(3)  # g remembers 3, f remembers 2
g(4)  # 64
f(4)  # 16

def maker(N):
    action = (lambda x: x ** N)  # N remembered from enclosing def
    return action

x = maker(4)
print(x(2))  # Prints 16, 4 ** 2
```

```py
# If a lambda or def defined within a function is nested inside a loop, and
# the nested function references an enclosing scope variable that is changed
# by that loop, all functions generated within the loop will have the same
# value—the value the referenced variable had in the last loop iteration.
#
# It's because the enclosing scope variable is looked up when the nested
# functions are later called, they all effectively remember the same value:
# the value the loop variable had on the last loop iteration.
def make_actions():
    acts = []
    for i in range(5):  # Tries to remember each i
        acts.append(lambda x: i ** x)  # But all remember same last i!
    return acts

acts = make_actions()
[act(2) for act in acts]  # [16, 16, 16, 16, 16]

# That is, to make this sort of code work, we must pass in the current value
# of the enclosing scope’s variable with a default. Because defaults are
# evaluated when the nested function is created (not when it’s later called),
# each remembers its own value for i:
def make_actions():
    acts = []
    for i in range(5):  # Use defaults instead
        acts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x)  # Remember current i
    return acts

acts = make_actions()
[act(2) for act in acts]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

=== Generators

* A function `def` statement that contains a `yield` statement is turned into a _generator function_.
+
When called, it returns a new generator object with automatic retention of local scope and code position; an automatically created `+++__iter__+++` method that simply returns itself; and an automatically created `+++__next__+++` method (`next` in 2.X) that starts the function or resumes it where it last left off, and raises `StopIteration` when finished producing results.
+
```py
def gensquares(N):
    for i in range(N):
        yield i ** 2  # Resume here later


for i in gensquares(5):  # Resume the function
    print(i, end=' : ')  # Print last yielded value
# 0 : 1 : 4 : 9 : 16 :

x = gensquares(4)
# iter() is not required: a no-op here
iter(x) is x  # True
x.__next__()  # 0
x.__next__()  # 1
x.__next__()  # 4
x.__next__()  # 9
x.__next__()  # StopIteration
```
+
--
* State suspension

** Unlike normal functions that return a value and exit, generator functions automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the point of value generation.
+
Because of that, they are often a useful alternative to both computing an entire series of values up front and manually saving and restoring state in classes.

** The _state_ that generator functions retain when they are suspended includes both their code location, and their entire local scope. Hence, their _local variables_ retain information between results, and make it available when the functions are resumed.

** The chief code difference between generator and normal functions is that a generator _yields_ a value, rather than _returning_ one—the `yield` statement suspends the function and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable the function to resume from where it left off.
+
When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last `yield` run. From the function’s perspective, this allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and sending them back in something like a list.

* Iteration protocol integration

** Generator functions, coded as def statements containing yield statements, are automatically made to support the _iteration object protocol_ and thus may be used in any iteration context to produce results over time and on demand.
+
To support this protocol, functions containing a `yield` statement are compiled specially as generators—they are not normal functions, but rather are built to return an object with the expected iteration protocol methods. When later called, they return a generator object that supports the iteration interface with an automatically created method named `+++__next__+++` to start or resume execution.

** Generator functions may also have a `return` statement that, along with falling off the end of the `def` block, simply terminates the generation of values—technically, by raising a `StopIteration` exception after any normal function exit actions.
+
From the caller’s perspective, the generator’s `+++__next__+++` method resumes the function and runs until either the next yield result is returned or a `StopIteration` is raised.
--

* A comprehension expression enclosed in parentheses is known as a _generator expression_.
+
When run, it returns a new generator object with the same automatically created method interface and state retention as a generator function call’s results —with an `+++__iter__+++` method that simply returns itself; and a `+++__next__+++` method (`next` in 2.X) that starts the implied loop or resumes it where it last left off, and raises `StopIteration` when finished producing results.
+
```py
[x ** 2 for x in range(4)]  # list comprehension: build a list
# [0, 1, 4, 9]
(x ** 2 for x in range(4))  # generator expression: make an iterable
# <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7fcd7069b780>
```
+
--
* Generator expressions are a _memory-space_ optimization —they do not require the entire result list to be constructed all at once, as the squarebracketed list comprehension does.

* Generator expressions may run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation.
--

* Python 3.3 introduces extended syntax for the `yield` statement that allows delegation to a subgenerator with a `from generator` clause.
+
```py
def both(N):
    for i in range(N):
        yield i
    for i in (x ** 2 for x in range(N)):
        yield i

list(both(5))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

def both(N):
    yield from range(N)
    yield from (x ** 2 for x in range(N))

list(both(5))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

' : '.join(str(i) for i in both(5))  # '0 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 0 : 1 : 4 : 9 : 16'
```

* Generators are single-iteration objects, that support just one active iteration, and can’t have multiple iterators of either positioned at different locations in the set of results.
+
Because of this, a generator’s iterator is the generator itself; in fact, as suggested earlier, calling `iter` on a generator expression or function is an optional no-op.
+
```py
G = (c * 4 for c in 'SPAM')
iter(G) is G  # My iterator is myself: G has __next__
# True
```



=== Decorators

A _decorator_ is a function that takes one function as input and returns another function.

```py
def document_it(func):
    def new_function(*args, **kwargs):
        print('Running function:', func.__name__)
        print('Positional arguments:', args)
        print('Keyword arguments:', kwargs)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print('Result:', result)
        return result
    return new_function

def add_ints(a, b):
    return a+b

cooler_add_ints = document_it(add_ints)  # manual decorator assignment
cooler_add_ints(1, 2)
# Running function: add_ints
# Positional arguments: (1, 2)
# Keyword arguments: {}
# Result: 3
# 3

@document_it  # an alternative to the manual decorator assignment
def add_floats(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

def square_it(func):
    def new_function(*args, **kargs):
        result = func(*args, **kargs)
        return result*result
    return new_function

# more than one decorator for a function
@document_it
@square_it
def add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

add_numbers(2, 3)
# Running function: new_function
# Positional arguments: (2, 3)
# Keyword arguments: {}
# Result: 25
# 25
```

```py
def dump(func):
    "Print input arguments and output value(s)"
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Function name:", func.__name__)
        print("Input arguments:", ' '.join(map(str, args)))
        print("Input keyword arguments:", kwargs.items())
        output = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Output:", output)
        return output
    return wrapped
```

=== Exceptions

An exception is a class, which is a child of the class `Exception`.

```py
class OopsException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise OopsException('panic')  # raising exceptions
except OopsException as err:
    print(err)  # panic
except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError) as err:  # multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple
    pass
except Exception as other:  # except to catch all exceptions
    pass
except:  # bare except to catch all exceptions
    pass
```

== Classes

* Like the function `def` statement, the Python `class` statement is an executable statement, and generates a new class object and assigns it to the name in the class header when reached and run, and provides default behavior and serve as factories for instance objects.
+
```py
class name: ...  # standard class definition
class name(): ...  # less common approach (equivalent in functionality)
```

* The first argument (called `self` by convention) inside a class’s method functions references the instance object being processed and assignments to attributes of `self` create or change data in the instance, not the class.
+
```py
# superclass links are made by listing classes in parentheses in a class statement header.
class name(superclass, ...):  # assign to name
    # class attributes are created by statements (assignments) in class statements.
    attr = value  # class data attributes, shared by all instances

    def method(self, ...):  # methods
        # instance attributes are generated by assignments to self attributes in methods.
        self.attr = value  # per-instance data
```

* Like in module files, top-level assignments within a `class` statement (not nested in a `def`) generate attributes in the class object's local scope.

* A class object's attributes record state information and behavior to be shared by all instances created from the class and function `def` statements nested inside a `class` generate _methods_, which process instances.

*  Like a function, each time a class is called, it creates and returns a new instance object that inherits class attributes and gets its own namespace.
+
```py
class Cat:
    color = 'red'

cat = Cat()  # create an object from a class
tom = Cat()
jerry = Cat()
print(tom.color)  # red
print(jerry.color)  # red

tom.color = 'black'  # object attributes take precedence over class attributes when accessed or modified
Cat.color = 'blue'  # affect existing and new objects

butch = Cat()
print(jerry.color)  # blue
print(tom.color)  # black
print(butch.color)  # blue
```

* An instance method call `instance.method(args...)` is automatically mapped to a class’s method functions as `class.method(instance, args...)`.
+
```py
class Cat:
    def wow(self):
        print('meow!')

tom = Cat()
tom.wow()  # meow!
Cat.wow(tom)  # meow!
```

* The built-in `+++instance.__class__+++` attribute provides a link from an instance to the class from which it was created, and classes in turn have a `+++__name__+++`, and a `+++__bases__+++` sequence that provides access to superclasses.

* The built-in `+++object.__dict__+++` attribute provides a dictionary for every attribute attached to a namespace object (including modules, classes, and instances).
+
Because attribute fetch qualification also performs an inheritance search, it can access inherited attributes that namespace dictionary indexing cannot.
+
```py
class Super:
    def hello(self):
        self.data1 = 'spam'

class Sub(Super):
    def hola(self):
        self.data2 = 'eggs'

x = Sub()
x.__dict__  # instance namespace dict
# {}
x.__class__  # class of instance
# <class '__main__.Sub'>
x.__class__.__name__
# 'Sub'
Sub.__bases__  # superclasses of class
# (<class '__main__.Super'>,)
Super.__bases__
# (<class 'object'>,)

x.hello()
x.__dict__
# {'data1': 'spam'}
x.hola()
x.__dict__
# {'data1': 'spam', 'data2': 'eggs'}
x.data1, x.__dict__['data1']
# ('spam', 'spam')
x.data3 = 'toast'
x.__dict__
# {'data1': 'spam', 'data2': 'eggs', 'data3': 'toast'}

x.__dict__['hello']
# KeyError: 'hello'
```

* In Python, the `super()` function is used to access the parent class's methods and attributes and helps to call the parent class constructors in `+++__init__+++` in the correct order based on the method resolution order (MRO).

* In classes, operator overloading is implemented by providing specially methods named with double underscores (`+++__X__+++`) to intercept operations.
+
```py
# initialization: __init__(), to save syllables, double underscores (__), also pronounce as dunder.
class Cat:
    # self is not a reserved word, but it’s common as the first argument to refer to the object itself.
    def __init__(self, name):  # initializer
        self.name = name

    # a method is a function in a class or object.
    def wow(self):
        print(f'{self.name:}: meow!')


cat = Cat('Tom')
cat.wow()  # Tom: meow!
Cat.wow(cat)  # Tom: meow!
```

=== Operator overloading

* Operator overloading lets classes intercept normal Python operations.
* Classes can overload all Python expression operators.
* Classes can also overload built-in operations such as printing, function calls, attribute access, etc.
* Overloading makes class instances act more like built-in types.
* Overloading is implemented by providing specially named methods in a class.

==== Constructors and destructions: +++__init__+++, +++__del__+++

The `+++__init__+++` _constructor_ is called whenever an instance is generated, and its counterpart, the `+++__del__+++` _destructor_ is run automatically when an instance’s space is being reclaimed (i.e., at “garbage collection” time).

* Technically, instance creation first triggers the `+++__new__+++` method, which creates and returns the new instance object, which is then passed into `+++__init__+++` for initialization.

* Python automatically reclaims all memory space held by an instance when the instance is reclaimed, destructors are not necessary for space management. It’s often better to code termination activities in an explicitly called method (e.g., `shutdown`), and the `try/finally` statement also supports termination actions, as does the `with` statement for objects that support its context manager model.
+
```py
class Life:
    def __init__(self, name='unknown'):
        print('Hello ' + name)
        self.name = name

    def live(self):
        print(self.name)

    def __del__(self):
        print('Goodbye ' + self.name)
```
+
```py
brian = Life('Brian')  # Hello Brian
brian.live()  # Brian
brian = 'loretta'  # Goodbye Brian
```

==== Indexing and slicing: +++__getitem__+++ and +++__setitem__+++

* When an instance `X` appears in an _indexing expression_ like `X[i]`, Python calls the `+++__getitem__+++` method inherited by the instance, passing `X` and the index in brackets to the arguments.
+
```py
class Indexer:
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return index ** 2

X = Indexer()
X[2]  # X[i] calls X.__getitem__(i)
# 4
for i in range(5):
    print(X[i], end=' ')  # Runs __getitem__(X, i) each time
# 0 1 4 9 16
```

* In addition to indexing, `+++__getitem__+++` is also called for _slice expressions_—using upper and lower bounds and a stride bundled up into a slice object.
+
```py
class Indexer:
    data = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    def __getitem__(self, index: int | slice) -> int | list[int]:  # Called for index or slice
        print('getitem:', index)
        return self.data[index]  # Perform index or slice
```
+
```py
X = Indexer()
X[0]
# getitem: 0
# 5
X[-1]
# getitem: -1
# 9
X[2:4]
# getitem: slice(2, 4, None)
# [7, 8]
X[1:]
# getitem: slice(1, None, None)
# [6, 7, 8, 9]
X[:-1]
# getitem: slice(None, -1, None)
# [5, 6, 7, 8]
X[::2]
# getitem: slice(None, None, 2)
# [5, 7, 9]
```

* The `+++__getitem__+++` may be also called automatically as an iteration fallback option (all iteration contexts will try the `+++__iter__+++` method first), for example, the `for` loops, `in` membership test, list comprehensions, the `map` built-in, list and tuple assignments, and type constructors.
+
```py
class StepperIndex:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.data[i]
```
+
```py
X = StepperIndex('Spam')

X[1]  # Indexing calls __getitem__
# 'p'

for item in X:  # for loops call __getitem__
    print(item, end=' ')  # for indexes items 0..N
# S p a m 
'p' in X  # All call __getitem__ too
# True
[c for c in X]  # List comprehension
# ['S', 'p', 'a', 'm']
list(map(str.upper, X))  # map calls
# ['S', 'P', 'A', 'M']
(a, b, c, d) = X  # Sequence assignments
a, c, d
# ('S', 'a', 'm')
list(X), tuple(X), ''.join(X)  # And so on...
# (['S', 'p', 'a', 'm'], ('S', 'p', 'a', 'm'), 'Spam')
```

* The `+++__setitem__+++` index assignment method similarly intercepts both index and slice assignments.
+
```py
class IndexSetter:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):  # Intercept index or slice assignment
        self.data[index] = value  # Assign index or slice
```

* The `+++__index__+++` method returns an integer value for an instance when needed and is used by built-ins that convert to digit strings.
+
```py
class C:
    def __index__(self):
        return 255
```
+
```py
X = C()
hex(X)  # '0xff'
bin(X)  # '0b11111111'
oct(X)  # '0o377'
```

==== Iterable objects: +++__iter__+++ and +++__next__+++

* Technically, iteration contexts work by passing an iterable object to the `iter` built-in function to invoke an `+++__iter__+++` method, which is expected to return an iterator object.

* If it’s provided, Python then repeatedly calls the iterator object’s `+++__next__+++` method to produce items until a `StopIteration` exception is raised.

* A `next` built-in function is also available as a convenience for manual iterations—`next(I)` is the same as `I.__next__()`.

* The iterable object interface (i.e., _iteration protocol_) is given priority and attempted first, and only if no such `+++__iter__+++` method is found, Python falls back on the `+++__getitem__+++` scheme and repeatedly indexes by offsets as before, until an `IndexError` exception is raised.
+
```py
class Squares:
    def __init__(self, start, stop):  # Save state when created
        self.value = start - 1
        self.stop = stop

    def __iter__(self):  # Get iterator object on iter
        return self  # One-shot iteration, single traversal only

    def __next__(self):  # Return a square on each iteration
        if self.value == self.stop:  # Also called by next built-in
            raise StopIteration
        self.value += 1
        return self.value ** 2
```

* To achieve the multiple-iterator effect on one object, `+++__iter__+++` simply needs to define a new stateful object for the iterator, instead of returning `self` for each iterator request.
+
```py
class SkipObject:
    def __init__(self, wrapped):  # Save item to be used
        self.wrapped = wrapped

    def __iter__(self):
        return SkipIterator(self.wrapped)  # New iterator each time

class SkipIterator:
    def __init__(self, wrapped):
        self.wrapped = wrapped  # Iterator state information
        self.offset = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self.offset >= len(self.wrapped):  # Terminate iterations
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            item = self.wrapped[self.offset]  # else return and skip
            self.offset += 2
            return item
```

==== Membership: +++__contains__, __iter__, and __getitem__+++

* In the iterations domain, classes can implement the `in` membership operator as an iteration, using either the `+++__iter__+++` or `+++__getitem__+++` methods.

* To support more specific membership, though, classes may code a `+++__contains__+++` method—when present, this method is preferred over `+++__iter__+++`, which is preferred over `+++__getitem__+++`.

* The `+++__contains__+++` method should define membership as applying to keys for a mapping (and can use quick lookups), and as a search for _sequences_.
+
```py
class Iters:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.data = value

    def __getitem__(self, i):  # Fallback for iteration
        print('get[%s]:' % i, end='')  # Also for index, slice
        return self.data[i]

    def __iter__(self):  # Preferred for iteration
        print('iter=> next:', end='')  # Allows multiple active iterators
        for x in self.data:  # no __next__ to alias to next
            yield x
            print('next:', end='')

    def __contains__(self, x):  # Preferred for 'in'
        print('contains: ', end='')
        return x in self.data
```

==== Attribute access: +++__getattr__ and __setattr__+++

* The `+++__getattr__+++` method intercepts attribute references.

** It’s called with the attribute name as a string whenever trying to qualify an instance with an undefined (nonexistent) attribute name.

** It is not called if Python can find the attribute using its inheritance tree search procedure.
+
```py
class Empty:
    def __getattr__(self, attrname):  # On self.undefined
        if attrname == 'age':  # age becomes a dynamically computed attribute
            return 40
        else:
            raise AttributeError(attrname)  # raises the builtin AttributeError exception
```
+
```py
X = Empty()
X.age  # 40
X.name  # AttributeError: name
```

* In the same department, the `+++__setattr__+++` intercepts all attribute assignments.

** If the method is defined or inherited, `self.attr = value` becomes `+++self.__setattr__('attr', value)+++`.

** Assigning to any `self` attributes within `+++__setattr__+++` calls `+++__setattr__+++` again, potentially causing an infinite recursion loop.

** Avoid loops by coding instance attribute assignments as assignments to attribute dictionary keys:  `self.__dict__['name'] = x`, not `self.name = x`.
+
```py
class Accesscontrol:
    def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
        if attr == 'age':
            self.__dict__[attr] = value + 10  # Not self.name=val or setattr
            # It’s also possible to avoid recursive loops in a class that uses __setattr__ by routing
            # any attribute assignments to a higher superclass with a call, instead of assigning keys
            # in __dict__:
            #    self.__dict__[attr] = value + 10 # OK: doesn't loop
            #    object.__setattr__(self, attr, value + 10) # OK: doesn't loop (new-style only)
        else:
            raise AttributeError(attr + ' not allowed')
```
+
```py
X = Accesscontrol()
X.age = 40
X.age  # 50
X.name = 'Bob'  # AttributeError: name not allowed
```

* A third attribute management method, `+++__delattr__+++`, is passed the attribute name string and invoked on all attribute deletions (i.e., `del object.attr`).

** Like `+++__setattr__+++`, it must avoid recursive loops by routing attribute deletions with the using class through `+++__dict__+++` or a superclass.

==== String representation: +++__repr__ and __str__+++

If defined, `+++__repr__+++` (or its close relative, `+++__str__+++`) is called automatically when class instances are printed or converted to strings.

* `+++__str__+++` is tried first for the `print` operation and the `str` built-in function (the internal equivalent of which `print` runs). It generally should return a user-friendly display.

* `+++__repr__+++` is used in all other contexts: for interactive echoes, the `repr` function, and nested appearances, as well as by `print` and `str` if no `+++__str__+++` is present. It should generally return an as-code string that could be used to re-create the object, or a detailed display for developers.
+
```py
class adder:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.data = value  # Initialize data

    def __add__(self, other):
        self.data += other  # Add other in place (bad form?)
```
+
```py
x = adder()  # Default displays
print(x)
# <__main__.adder object at 0x7fd1fd745a50>
x
# <__main__.adder object at 0x7fd1fd745a50>
```
+
```py
class addrepr(adder):  # Inherit __init__, __add__
    def __repr__(self):  # Add string representation
        return 'addrepr(%s)' % self.data  # Convert to as-code string
```
+
```py
x = addrepr(2)
x  # Runs __repr__
# addrepr(2)
print(x)  # Runs __repr__
# addrepr(2)
str(x), repr(x)  # Runs __repr__ for both
# ('addrepr(2)', 'addrepr(2)')
```
+
```py
class addstr(adder):
    def __str__(self):  # __str__ but no __repr__
        return '[Value: %s]' % self.data  # Convert to nice string
```
+
```py
x = addstr(3)
x  # Default __repr__
# <demo.addstr object at 0x7fd1fd63d2d0>
print(x)  # # Runs __str__
# [Value: 3]
str(x), repr(x)
# ('[Value: 3]', '<demo.addstr object at 0x7fd1fd63d2d0>')
```
+
```py
class addboth(adder):
    def __str__(self):
        return '[Value: %s]' % self.data  # User-friendly string

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'addboth(%s)' % self.data  # As-code string
```
+
```py
x = addboth(4)
x  # Runs __repr__
# addboth(4)
print(x)  # Runs __str__
# [Value: 4]
str(x), repr(x)
# ('[Value: 4]', 'addboth(4)')
```

==== Right-side and in-place uses: +++__radd__ and __iadd__+++

* Every binary operator has a left, right, and in-place variant overloading methods (e.g., `+++__add__+++`, `+++__radd__+++`, and `+++__iadd__+++`).

* For example, the `+++__add__+++` for objects on the left is called instead in all other cases and does not support the use of instance objects on the right side of the `+` operator.
+
```py
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.data = value

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.data+other
```
+
```py
x = Number(5)
x + 2
# 7
2 + x
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Number'
```

* To implement more general expressions, and hence support commutative-style operators, code the `+++__radd__+++` method as well.
+
```py
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.data = value

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.data+other

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.data+other

    # Reusing __add__ in __radd__
    # def __radd__(self, other):
    #     return self.__add__(other)  # Call __add__ explicitly
    #     return self + other  # Swap order and re-add
    # __radd__ = __add__  # Alias: cut out the middleman
```
+
```py
x = Number(5)
x + 2
# 7
2 + x
# 7
```

* To also implement `+=` in-place augmented addition, code either an `+++__iadd__+++` or an `+++__add__+++`. The latter is used if the former is absent, but may not be able optimize in-place cases.
+
```py
class Number:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.data = value

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.data+other

    __radd__ = __add__

    def __iadd__(self, other):  # __iadd__ explicit: x += y
        self.data += other  # Usually returns self
        return self
```
+
```py
x = Number(5)
x += 1
x += 1
x.data
# 7
```

== Automatic resource management

```py
fi = open('test.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
try:
    fi.write('hello world')
finally:
    fi.close()
```

```py
with open('test.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as fo:
    txt = fo.read()
    print(txt)
```

The `with` statement can be used with any object that implements the `+++__enter__()+++` and `+++__exit__()+++` special methods that provide hooks for initializing and finalizing resource management. Common resources managed with with include:

* Files: The with `open('filename', 'mode') as file:` syntax opens a file, assigns it to a variable (`file`), and automatically closes the file when the indented block exits, even in case of exceptions.

* Database Connections: `with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as con:` creates a connection, assigns it to a variable, and guarantees closure upon exiting the block.

* Locks: In multithreaded environments, with can be used with lock objects to acquire a lock at the beginning of the block and release it at the end, ensuring proper synchronization.

```py
class Cat:
    """A custom context manager class that simulates a cat entering and leaving."""

    def __enter__(self) -> "Cat":
        """
        Called when entering the `with` block. Prints a message and returns itself.

        Returns:
            The Cat instance (self) to be used within the `with` block.

== Modules and packages

```py
# A module is a single Python file (.py extension) containing Python code,
# that can include functions, classes, variables, and statements.

# animal.py (module file)
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, voice: str) -> None:
        self.__voice = voice

    def wow(self):
        print(f'{self.__voice}!')
```

```py
# A package is a directory containing multiple Python modules and potentially
# subdirectories with even more modules, that represents a collection of related
# modules organized under a common namespace.
#
# A package import turns a directory into another Python namespace, with attributes
# corresponding to the subdirectories and module files that the directory contains.

# .
# ├── animals
# │   ├── cat.py
# │   ├── dog.py
# │   └── __init__.py
# └── main.py

# animals/cat.py 
def wow():
    print('meow!')

# animals/dog.py 
def wow():
    print('bark!')

# main.py
from animals import cat  # from package import module
import animals.dog as dog  # import package.module

cat.wow()  # meow!
dog.wow()  # bark!
```

=== search path

In the context of programming languages and environments, the search path refers to a list of directories that the program or interpreter looks at to locate specific files, particularly modules or libraries, that is composed of the concatenation of the four major components, that ultimately becomes `sys.path`, a mutable list of directory name strings:

1. Home directory (automatic)

* When running a program, this entry is the directory containing the program’s top-level script file.

* When working _interactively_, this entry is the directory in the working (i.e., the current working directory).

2. PYTHONPATH directories (if set)

* In brief, PYTHONPATH is simply a list of user-defined and platform-specific names of directories that contain Python code files.
 
* The `os.pathsep` constant in Python provides the provide platform-specific directory path separator on the module search path.

** Windows: `C:\Python310;C:\Users\YourName\Documents\my_modules`
+
```py
import os, platform

platform.system(), os.pathsep  # ('Windows', ';')
```
** Linux/macOS: `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages:/home/yourname/my_modules`
+
```py
import os, platform

platform.system(), os.pathsep  # ('Linux', ':')
```

3. Standard library directories

4. The contents of any .pth files (if present)

5. The _site-packages_ directory of third-party extensions (automatic)

```py
import sys
for path in sys.path:
    print(f"'{path}'")

''  # current working directory where the script is located
'/usr/lib/python311.zip'  # standard library, built-in modules
'/usr/lib/python3.11'
'/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload'  # dynamically loaded modules or libraries
'/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages'  # third-party libraries
'/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages'

# sys.path is a list, and can be updated programmlly
sys.path
# ['', '/usr/lib/python311.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.11', '/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages']
sys.path.insert(0, '/tmp')
sys.path
# ['/tmp', '', '/usr/lib/python311.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.11', '/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages']
```

=== +++__init__.py+++

```py
# dir0\ # Container on module search path
#     dir1\
#         __init__.py
#         dir2\
#             __init__.py
#             mod.py

import dir1.dir2.mod
```

* `dir1` and `dir2` both must contain an `+++__init__.py+++` file at least until Python 3.3.

* `dir0`, the container, does not require an `+++__init__.py+++` file; this file will simply be ignored if present.

* `dir0`, not `dir0\dir1`, must be listed on the module search path `sys.path`.

The `+++__init__.py+++` file serves as a hook for package initialization-time actions, declares a directory as a package, generates a module namespace for a directory, and implements the behavior of `from *` (i.e., `from .. import *`) statements when used with directory imports:

* Package initialization: The first time a Python program imports through a directory, it automatically runs all the code in the directory’s `+++__init__.py+++` file which a natural place to put code to initialize the state required by files in a package.

* Module usability declarations: Package `+++__init__.py+++` files are also partly present to declare that a directory is a regular module package.

* Module namespace initialization: In the package import model, the directory paths in a script become real nested object paths after an import.

* `from *` statement behavior: As an advanced feature, the `+++__all__+++` lists in `+++__init__.py+++` files can define what is exported when a directory is imported with the `from *` statement form.

=== the import and from statements, and the reload call

* `import` fetches the module as a whole, and must qualify to fetch its names.
+
```py
import module_name
```

* `from` fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module over to another scope, and when using a `*` (used only at the top level of a module file, not within a function) instead of specific names, it copies of all names assigned at the top level of the referenced module.
+
```py
# import specific functions or classes from a module.
from module_name import element1, element2
# import a specific element and assign it an alias for easier use.
from module_name import element1 as alias
# copy out _all_ variables
from module_name import *
```

* Like `def`, `import` and `from` are executable statements, not compile-time declarations, and they are implicit assignments:

** `import` assigns an entire module object to a single name.

** `from` assigns one or more names to objects of the same names in another module.

* Modules are loaded and run on the first `import` or `from`, and only the first.

* Unlike `import` and `from`:
+
--
** `reload` is a function in Python, not a statement.

** `reload` is passed an existing module object, not a new name.

** `reload` lives in a module in Python 3.X and must be imported itself.
--
+
```py
# import module                 # initial import
# ...use module.attributes...
# ...                           # now, go change the module file
# ...
# from importlib import reload  # get reload itself (in 3.x)
# reload(module)                # get updated exports
# ...use module.attributes...
```

* A _namespace package_ is not fundamentally different from a _regular package_ (must have an `+++__init__.py+++` file that is run automatically); it is just a different way of creating packages which are still relative to `sys.path` at the
top level: the leftmost component of a dotted namespace package path must still be located in an entry on the normal module search path.
+
```py
import dir1.dir2.mod
from dir1.dir2.mod import x
import splitdir.mod
```
+
```sh
mkdir -p /code/ns/dir{1,2}/sub  # two dirs of same name in different dirs
```
+
```py
# module files in different directories

# /code/ns/dir1/sub/mod1.py
print(r'dir1\sub\mod1')

# /code/ns/dir2/sub/mod2.py
print(r'dir2\sub\mod2')
```
+
```sh
PYTHONPATH=/code/ns/dir1:/code/ns/dir2 python -q
```
+
```py
import sub
sub  # namespace packages: nested search paths
# <module 'sub' (<_frozen_importlib_external.NamespaceLoader object at 0x7fd1eeda5c50>)>
sub.__path__
# _NamespacePath(['/code/ns/dir1/sub', '/code/ns/dir2/sub'])

from sub import mod1
# dir1\sub\mod1
import sub.mod2  # content from two different directories
# dir2\sub\mod2

mod1
# <module 'sub.mod1' from '/code/ns/dir1/sub/mod1.py'>
sub.mod2
# <module 'sub.mod2' from '/code/ns/dir2/sub/mod2.py'>
```

* The `from` statement can use leading dots (`.`) to specify that it require modules located within the same package (known as _package relative imports_), instead of modules located elsewhere on the module import search path (called _absolute imports_).
+
```py
# mypkg\
#     __init__.py
#     main.py
#     string.py
from . import string # relative to this package, imports mypkg.string
from .string import name1, name2 # imports names from mypkg.string
from .. import string # imports string sibling of mypkg
```
+
```console
├── main.py
└── spam
    ├── eggs.py
    ├── ham.py
    └── __init__.py
```
+
```py
# spam/ham.py
from . import eggs
print('eggs')
```
+
```py
# main.py
from spam import ham
```
+
```console
$ python3 main.py
eggs
```

=== _X, +++__all__+++, +++__name__+++, and +++__main__+++

* Python looks for an `+++__all__+++` list in the module first and copies its names irrespective of any underscores; if `+++__all__+++` is not defined, `from *` copies all names without a single leading underscore (`_X`):
+
```py
# unders.py
a, _b, c, _d = 1, 2, 3, 4
```
+
```py
from unders import * # Load non _X names only
a, c  # (1, 3)
_b  # NameError: name '_b' is not defined

import unders # But other importers get every name
unders._b  # 2
```
+
```py
# alls.py
__all__ = ['a', '_c'] # __all__ has precedence over _X
a, b, _c, _d = 1, 2, 3, 4
```
+
```py
from alls import *  # load __all__ names only
a, _c  # (1, 3)
b  # NameError: name 'b' is not defined
from alls import a, b, _c, _d  # but other importers get every name
a, b, _c, _d  # (1, 2, 3, 4)

import alls
alls.a, alls.b, alls._c, alls._d  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

* If a module’s `+++__name__+++` variable is the string "+++__main__+++", it means that the file is being executed as a top-level script as a program instead of being imported from another file as a library in the program.
+
```py
# cat.py
def wow():
    return __name__

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f'executed: {wow()}')
```
+
```console
$ python3 cat.py  # directly executed (as a script)
executed: __main__
```
+
```py
# imported by another module
from cat import wow
print(f'imported: {wow()}')  # imported: cat
```

=== Importing modules by name strings

* To import the referenced module given its string name, build and run an `import` statement with `exec`, or pass the string name in a call to the `+++__import__+++` or `importlib.import_module`.
+
```py
# The `import` statements can’t directly to load a module given its name as a
# string—Python expects a variable name that’s taken literally and not evalu-
# ated, not a string or expression.
import 'string'
#   File "<stdin>", line 1
#     import 'string'
#            ^^^^^^^^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
+
```py
# The most general approach is to construct an `import` statement as a string of Python
# code and pass it to the `exec` built-in function to run, but it must compile the `import`
# statement each time it runs, and compiling can be slow.
modname = 'string'
exec('import ' + modname) # Run a string of code
string
# <module 'string' from '/usr/lib/python3.11/string.py'>
```
+
```py
# In most cases it’s probably simpler and may run quicker to use the built-in `__import__`
# function to load from a name string instead, which returns the module object, so assign it
# to a name here to keep it.
modname = 'string'
string = __import__(modname)
string
# <module 'string' from '/usr/lib/python3.11/string.py'>
```
+
```py
# The newer call `importlib.import_module` does the same work as the built-in `__import__`
# function, and is generally preferred in more recent Pythons for direct calls to import
# by name string.
import importlib
modname = 'string'
string = importlib.import_module(modname)
```

=== pip: pip install packages

```sh
# ensure can run pip from the command line
python3 -m pip --version  # pip --version
# pip 23.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.11)

# OR, install pip, venv modules in Debian/Ubuntu for the system python.
apt install python3-pip python3-venv  # On Debian/Ubuntu systems
```
==== virtual environment

```sh
# create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv python-learning-notes_env

# active a virtual environment
source python-learning-notes_env/bin/activate

# ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# show pip version 
pip --version  # python3 -m pip --version
# pip 24.0 from .../python-learning-notes_env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pip (python 3.11)

# deactive a virtual environment: the deactivate command is often implemented as a shell function.
deactivate
```

==== pip install

```sh
# install the latest stable version.
pip install <package_name>

# install a package with extras, i.e., optional dependencies (e.g., pip install 'transformers[torch]').
pip install <package_name>[extra1[,extra2,...]]

# install the exact version (e.g., pip install vllm==0.4.3).
pip install <package_name>==<version>

# install the latest version greater than or equal to the specified one (e.g., pip install vllm>=0.4.0 gets anything from 0.4.0 onwards), but within the same major version.
pip install <package_name>>=<version>

# install the latest patch version (tilde operator) within the specified major and minor version (e.g., pip install vllm~0.4).
pip install <package_name>~<version>

# upgrade an already installed to the latest from PyPI.
pip install --upgrade <package_name>

# install from an alternate index
pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ <package_name>

# search an additional index during install, in addition to PyPI
pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple <package_name>

# install pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions
pip install --pre <package_name>
```

==== cache, configuration

```sh
# get the cache directory that pip is currently configured to use
pip cache dir  # ~/.cache/pip
```

```ini
# INI format configuration files can change the default values for command line options.
#   - global: system-wide configuration file, shared across users.
#   - user: per-user configuration file.
#   - site: per-environment configuration file; i.e. per-virtualenv.

# the names of the settings are derived from the long command line option.
[global]
timeout = 60
index-url = https://download.zope.org/ppix

# per-command section: pip install
[install]
ignore-installed = true
no-dependencies = yes
```

==== mirror

```sh
# set the PyPI mirror
pip config --user set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# pip config --user set global.index-url https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
# pip config set global.extra-index-url "https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/"
```

==== pipenv

Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects, is similar in spirit to Node.js’ npm or Ruby’s bundler.

```sh
# install pipenv in Debian/Ubuntu for the system python.
apt install pipenv
```

```sh
# install pipenv for the user python.
pip install pipenv --user

# If pipenv isn’t available in a shell after installation, add the user site-packages binary directory to `PATH`.
#
# On Windows, the user base binary directory can be found by running
# `python -m site --user-site`
# and replacing `site-packages` with `Scripts`.
#
# On Linux and macOS, find the user base binary directory by running
# `python -m site --user-base`
# and appending `bin` to the end.
```

[TIP]
====
Debian/Linux might not work due to limitations with user-based installations.

. Using `apt`
+
```sh
apt install pipenv
```

. Using `pip` with virtualenv
+
```sh
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv pipenv_env

# Activate the virtual environment (replace "pipenv_env" with your chosen name)
source pipenv_env/bin/activate

# Install pipenv within the virtual environment
pip install pipenv

# Deactivate the virtual environment (optional)
deactivate
```

=== subprocess and multiprocessing

```py
import subprocess

# run another program in a shell 
# and grab whatever output it created (both standard output and standard error output)
print(subprocess.getoutput('date'))  # Thu Jun  6 07:19:50 PM CST 2024

# A variant method called `check_output()` takes a list of the command and arguments.
# By default it returns standard output only as type bytes rather than a string, and
# does not use the shell:
print(subprocess.check_output(['date', '-u']))  # b'Thu Jun  6 11:30:09 AM UTC 2024\n'

# return a tuple with the status code and output of the other program
print(subprocess.getstatusoutput('date'))  # (0, 'Thu Jun  6 07:32:25 PM CST 2024')

# capture the exit status only
ret = subprocess.call('date -u', shell=True)
# Thu Jun  6 11:45:51 AM UTC 2024
print(ret)
# 0

# makes a list of the arguments, not need to call the shell
ret = subprocess.call(['date', '-u'])
# Thu Jun  6 11:50:04 AM UTC 2024
print(ret)
# 0
```

```py
# create multiple independent processes
import multiprocessing
import os

def whoami(what):
    print("Process %s says: %s" % (os.getpid(), what))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    whoami("I'm the main program")
    for n in range(4):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(
            target=whoami, args=("I'm function %s" % n,))
        p.start()

# Process 1648 says: I'm the main program
# Process 1649 says: I'm function 0
# Process 1650 says: I'm function 1
# Process 1651 says: I'm function 2
# Process 1652 says: I'm function 3
```

```py
# kill a process with terminate()
import multiprocessing
import time
import os

def whoami(name):
    print("I'm %s, in process %s" % (name, os.getpid()))

def loopy(name):
    whoami(name)
    start = 1
    stop = 1000000
    for num in range(start, stop):
        print("\tNumber %s of %s. Honk!" % (num, stop))
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    whoami("main")
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=loopy, args=("loopy",))
    p.start()
    time.sleep(5)
    p.terminate()

# I'm main, in process 13084
# I'm loopy, in process 14664
#         Number 1 of 1000000. Honk!
#         Number 2 of 1000000. Honk!
#         Number 3 of 1000000. Honk!
#         Number 4 of 1000000. Honk!
#         Number 5 of 1000000. Honk!
```

=== Queues, processes, and threads

A queue is like a list: things are added at one end and taken away from the other, which most common is referred to as FIFO (first in, first out). In general, queues transport messages, which can be any kind of information, for distributed task management, also known as _work queues_, _job queues_, or _task queues_.

Threads can be dangerous. Like manual memory management in languages such as C and C++, they can cause bugs that are extremely hard to find, let alone fix. To use threads, all the code in the program (and in external libraries that it uses) must be _thread safe_.

In Python, threads do not speed up CPU-bound tasks because of an implementation detail in the standard Python system called the _Global Interpreter Lock_ (GIL).

* Use threads for I/O-bound problems

* Use processes, networking, or events (discussed in the next section) for CPU-bound problems

```py
import multiprocessing as mp

def washer(dishes, output):
    for dish in dishes:
        print('Washing', dish, 'dish')
        output.put(dish)

def dryer(input):
    while True:
        dish = input.get()
        print('Drying', dish, 'dish')
        input.task_done()

dish_queue = mp.JoinableQueue()
dryer_proc = mp.Process(target=dryer, args=(dish_queue,))
dryer_proc.daemon = True
dryer_proc.start()
dishes = ['salad', 'bread', 'entree', 'dessert']
washer(dishes, dish_queue)
dish_queue.join()

# Washing salad dish
# Washing bread dish
# Washing entree dish
# Washing dessert dish
# Drying salad dish
# Drying bread dish
# Drying entree dish
# Drying dessert dish
```

```py
import threading
import queue
import time

def washer(dishes, dish_queue):
    for dish in dishes:
        print("Washing", dish)
        time.sleep(5)
        dish_queue.put(dish)

def dryer(dish_queue):
    while True:
        dish = dish_queue.get()
        print("Drying", dish)
        time.sleep(10)
        dish_queue.task_done()

dish_queue = queue.Queue()
for n in range(2):
    dryer_thread = threading.Thread(target=dryer, args=(dish_queue,))
    dryer_thread.start()
dishes = ['salad', 'bread', 'entree', 'dessert']
washer(dishes, dish_queue)
dish_queue.join()

# Washing salad
# Washing bread
# Drying salad
# Washing entree
# Drying bread
# Washing dessert
# Drying entree
# Drying dessert
```

=== concurrent.futures

The `concurrent.futures` module in the standard library can be used to schedule an asynchronous pool of workers, using threads (when I/O-bound) or processes (when CPU-bound), and get back a `future` to track their state and collect the results.

Use concurrent.futures any time to launch a bunch of concurrent tasks, such as the following:

* Crawling URLs on the web
* Processing files, such as resizing images
* Calling service APIs

```py
from concurrent import futures
import math
import sys

def calc(val):
    result = math.sqrt(float(val))
    return val, result

def use_threads(num, values):
    with futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(num) as tex:
        tasks = [tex.submit(calc, value) for value in values]
        for f in futures.as_completed(tasks):
            yield f.result()

def use_processes(num, values):
    with futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(num) as pex:
        tasks = [pex.submit(calc, value) for value in values]
        for f in futures.as_completed(tasks):
            yield f.result()

def main(workers, values):
    print(f"Using {workers} workers for {len(values)} values")
    print("Using threads:")
    for val, result in use_threads(workers, values):
        print(f'{val} {result:.4f}')
    print("Using processes:")
    for val, result in use_processes(workers, values):
        print(f'{val} {result:.4f}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    workers = 3
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        workers = int(sys.argv[1])
        values = list(range(1, 6))  # 1 .. 5
    main(workers, values)
```

=== Asynchronous programming with async and await

In Python 3.4, Python added a standard _asynchronous_ module called `asyncio`. Python 3.5 then added the keywords `async` and `await`. These implement some new concepts: 

* _Coroutines_ are functions that pause at various points

* An _event loop_ that schedules and runs coroutines

```py
import asyncio

async def say(phrase, seconds):
    print(phrase)
    await asyncio.sleep(seconds)

async def wicked():
    task_1 = asyncio.create_task(say("Surrender,", 2))
    task_2 = asyncio.create_task(say("Dorothy!", 0))
    await task_1
    await task_2

#  blocking: runs the passed coroutine in the default executor, which given a timeout duration of 5 minutes to shutdown
asyncio.run(wicked())
```

```py
import asyncio

async def say(phrase, seconds):
    print(phrase)
    await asyncio.sleep(seconds)

async def wicked():
    task_1 = asyncio.create_task(say("Surrender,", 2))
    task_2 = asyncio.create_task(say("Dorothy!", 0))
    await asyncio.gather(task_1, task_2)  # Wait for all tasks to finish concurrently

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(wicked())
loop.close()
```

== SQL
 
DB-API (Database API), similar to JDBC in Java, is a standardized interface for Python that allows us to interact with various relational databases using a consistent set of functions and methods, which can simplify database access by providing a common ground for working with different database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite.
 
* DB-API focuses on fundamental database operations like connecting, executing SQL queries, fetching results, and committing/rolling back transactions.
 
* Different database modules (e.g., `MySQLdb`, `psycopg2`, `sqlite3`) implement the DB-API standard, ensuring consistency in these core functionalities across various systems.
 
* DB-API promotes parameterization of SQL queries using placeholders (`%s`, `?`, etc.) for values, which enhances security by preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities and improves portability by separating data from the query itself.
 
=== Using DB-API with SQLite in Memory

```py
import sqlite3

# Connect to an in-memory database (no file needed)
with sqlite3.connect(":memory:") as connection:

    # Create a cursor object
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Create a table (assuming you don't have one)
    cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL)
''')

    # Insert some data using parameterization
    users = [("Alice", "alice@example.com"), ("Bob", "bob@example.com")]
    cursor.executemany(
        "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)", users)

    # Commit the changes
    connection.commit()

    # Query the data
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

    # Fetch all results
    results = cursor.fetchall()

    # Print the results
    for row in results:
        print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Username: {row[1]}, Email: {row[2]}")
```
