IP is the workhorse protocol of the TCP/IP protocol suite. All TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IGMP data gets transmitted as IP datagrams. IP provides a *_best-effort_*, *_connectionless_* datagram delivery service.

== IPv4 and IPv6 Headers

The normal size of the IPv4 header is 20 bytes, unless _options_ are present (which is rare).

The IPv6 header is twice as large but never has any options, may have _extension headers_.

The most significant bit of headers and datagrams is numbered 0 at the left, and the least significant bit of a 32-bit value is numbered 31 on the right.

* The 4 bytes in a 32-bit value are transmitted in the following order: bits _0–7_ first, then bits _8–15_, then _16–23_, and bits _24–31_ last.
* This is called *big endian byte ordering*, which is the byte ordering required for all binary integers in the TCP/IP headers as they traverse a network. It is also called *network byte order*.
* Computer CPUs that store binary integers in other formats, such as the *little endian* format, must convert the header values into network byte order for transmission and back again for reception.

.The IPv4 datagram format.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-protocol/ipv4-datagram.png[IPv4 Datagram,55%,55%]

* The header is of variable size, limited to fifteen 32-bit words (60 bytes) by the 4-bit _IHL_ field.
* A typical IPv4 header contains 20 bytes (no options).
* The source and destination addresses are 32 bits long.
*  Most of the second 32-bit word is used for the IPv4 _fragmentation_ function.
* A header _checksum_ helps ensure that the fields in the header are delivered correctly to the proper destination but does not protect the data.

.The IPv6 datagram format.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-protocol/ipv6-datagram.png[IPv6 Datagram,55%,55%]

* The IPv6 header is of fixed size (40 bytes) and contains 128-bit _source_ and _destination_ addresses.
* The _Next Header_ field is used to indicate the presence and types of additional extension headers that follow the IPv6 header, forming a _daisy chain of headers_ that may include special extensions or processing directives.
* Application data follows the header chain, usually immediately following a transport-layer header.

=== IP Header Fields

The first field (only 4 bits or one nibble wide) is the _Version_ field.

* It contains the version number of the IP datagram: _4_ for IPv4 and _6_ for IPv6.
* The headers for both IPv4 and IPv6 share the location of the _Version_ field but no others.
* Thus, the two protocols are not directly interoperable—a host or router must handle either IPv4 or IPv6 (or both, called *_dual stack_*) separately.

The _Internet Header Length (IHL)_ field is the number of 32-bit words in the IPv4 header, including any options.

* Because this is also a 4-bit field, the IPv4 header is limited to a maximum of fifteen 32-bit words or 60 bytes.
+
The normal value of this field (when no options are present) is 5.

* There is no such field in IPv6 because the header length is fixed at 40 bytes.

Following the header length, the original specification of IPv4 [RFC0791] specified a _Type of Service (ToS)_ byte, and IPv6 [RFC2460] specified the equivalent _Traffic Class_ byte.

*  Use of these never became widespread, so eventually this 8-bit field was split into two smaller parts and redefined by a set of RFCs ([RFC3260] [RFC3168][RFC2474] and others).

** The first 6 bits are now called the _Differentiated Services_ Field (_DS_ Field), and the last 2 bits are the _Explicit Congestion Notification_ (_ECN_) field or indicator bits.
** These RFCs now apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.
* These fields are used for special processing of the datagram when it is forwarded.

The _Total Length_ field is the total length of the IPv4 datagram in bytes.

* Using this field and the _IHL_ field, we know where the data portion of the datagram starts, and its length.

* Because this is a 16-bit field, the maximum size of an IPv4 datagram (including header) is 65,535 bytes.

* Although it is possible to send a 65,535-byte IP datagram, most link layers (such as Ethernet) are not able to carry one this large without fragmenting it (chopping it up) into smaller pieces.
+
Furthermore, a host is not required to be able to receive an IPv4 datagram larger than _576_ bytes.
+
In IPv6 a host must be able to process a datagram at least as large as the MTU of the link to which it is attached, and the minimum link MTU is _1280_ bytes.
+
When an IPv4 datagram is fragmented into multiple smaller fragments, each of which itself is an independent IP datagram, the _Total Length_ field reflects the length of the particular fragment.
+
In IPv6, fragmentation is not supported by the header, and the length is instead given by the _Payload Length_ field.
+
This field measures the length of the IPv6 datagram not including the length of the header; extension headers, however, are included in the _Payload Length_ field.

The _Identification_ field helps indentify each datagram sent by an IPv4 host.

* To ensure that the fragments of one datagram are not confused with those of another, the sending host normally increments an internal counter by 1 each time a datagram is sent (from one of its IP addresses) and copies the value of the counter into the IPv4 _Identification_ field.

* The _Identification_, _Flags_ and _Fragment Offset_ fields are most important for implementing fragmentation.
+
In IPv6, this field shows up in the _Fragmentation extension header_.

The _Time-to-Live_ field, or _TTL_, sets an upper limit on the number of routers through which a datagram can pass.

* It is initialized by the sender to some value (_64_ is recommended [RFC1122], although _128_ or _255_ is not uncommon) and decremented by _1_ by every router that forwards the datagram.

* When this field reaches _0_, the datagram is thrown away, and the sender is notified with an _ICMP_ message.
+
This prevents packets from getting caught in the network forever should an unwanted routing loop occur.

The _Protocol_ field in the IPv4 header contains a number indicating the type of data found in the payload portion of the datagram.

* The most common values are _17_ (for UDP) and _6_ (for TCP).
* This provides a demultiplexing feature so that the IP protocol can be used to carry payloads of more than one protocol type.
* Although this field originally specified the _transport-layer protocol_ the datagram is encapsulating, it is now understood to identify the encapsulated protocol, which may or not be a transport protocol.
+
For example, other encapsulations are possible, such as _IPv4-in-IPv4_ (value _4_).

* The official list of the possible values of the Protocol field is given in the assigned numbers page [AN].

The _Next Header_ field in the IPv6 header generalizes the _Protocol_ field from IPv4.

* It is used to indicate the type of header following the IPv6 header.

* This field may contain any values defined for the IPv4 _Protocol_ field, or any of the values associated with the IPv6 extension headers.

The _Header Checksum_ field is calculated over the IPv4 header only.

* This is important to understand because it means that the payload of the IPv4 datagram (e.g., TCP or UDP data) is not checked for correctness by the IP protocol. 
* Perhaps surprisingly, the IPv6 header does not have any checksum field.

Every IP datagram contains the _Source IP Address_ of the sender of the datagram and the _Destination IP Address_ of where the datagram is destined.

* These are 32-bit values for IPv4 and 128-bit values for IPv6, and they usually identify a single interface on a computer, although multicast and broadcast addresses  violate this rule.

=== The Internet Checksum

The Internet checksum is a 16-bit mathematical sum used to determine, with reasonably high probability, whether a received message or portion of a message matches the one sent.

Note that the Internet checksum algorithm is not the same as the common _cyclic redundancy check_ (CRC), which offers stronger protection. 

To compute the IPv4 header checksum for an outgoing datagram,

* the value of the datagram's _Checksum_ field is first set to 0.
* Then, the 16-bit one's complement sum of the header is calculated (the entire header is considered a sequence of 16-bit words).
* The 16-bit one's complement of this sum is then stored in the _Checksum_ field to make the datagram ready for transmission.
+
One's complement addition can be implemented by "end-round-carry addition": when a carry bit is produced using conventional (two's complement) addition, the carry is added back in as a 1 value.

When an IPv4 datagram is received, a checksum is computed across the whole header, including the value of the _Checksum_ field itself. Assuming there are no errors, the computed checksum value is always 0 (a one's complement of the value _FFFF_).

Note that for any nontrivial packet or header, the value of the _Checksum_ field in the packet can never be _FFFF_.

* If it were, the sum (prior to the final one's complement operation at the sender) would have to have been 0.
* No sum can ever be 0 using one's complement addition unless all the bytes are 0—something that never happens with any legitimate IPv4 header.

When the header is found to be bad (the computed checksum is nonzero), the IPv4 implementation discards the received datagram.

* No error message is generated.
* It is up to the higher layers to somehow detect the missing datagram and retransmit if necessary.

.The Internet checksum is the one's complement of a one's complement 16-bit sum of the data being checksummed (zero padding is used if the number of bytes being summed is odd). If the data being summed includes a _Checksum_ field, the field is first set to 0 prior to the checksum operation and then filled in with the computed checksum. To check whether an incoming block of data that contains a _Checksum_ field (header, payload, etc.) is valid, the same type of checksum is computed over the whole block (including the _Checksum_ field). Because the _Checksum_ field is essentially the inverse of the checksum of the rest of the data, computing the checksum on correctly received data should produce a value of 0.

== IP Forwarding

Conceptually, IP forwarding is simple, especially for a host.

* If the destination is directly connected to the host (e.g., a point-to-point link) or on a shared network (e.g., Ethernet), the IP datagram is sent directly to the destination—a router is not required or used.
* Otherwise, the host sends the datagram to a single router (called the _default router_) and lets the router deliver the datagram to its destination.

What differentiates a host from a router to IP is how IP datagrams are handled: a host never forwards datagrams it does not originate, whereas routers do.

In our general scheme, the IP protocol can receive a datagram either 

* from another protocol on the same machine (TCP, UDP, etc.) 
* or from a network interface.

The IP layer has some information in memory, usually called a *_routing table_* or *_forwarding table_*, which it searches each time it receives a datagram to send.
 
When a datagram is received from a network interface, IP first checks if the _destination IP address_ is one of

* its own IP addresses (i.e., one of the IP addresses associated with one of its network interfaces)
* or some other address for which it should receive traffic such as an IP broadcast or multicast address.
+
If so, the datagram is delivered to the protocol module specified by the _Protocol_ field in the IPv4 header or _Next Header_ field in the IPv6 header.
+
If the datagram is not destined for one of the IP addresses being used locally by the IP module, then

** (1) if the IP layer was configured to act as a router, the datagram is forwarded;
** or (2) the datagram is silently discarded.
** Under some circumstances (e.g., no route is known in case 1), an ICMP message may be sent back to the source indicating an error condition.

=== Forwarding Table

The IP protocol standards do not dictate the precise data required to be in a _forwarding table_, as this choice is left up to the implementer of the IP protocol.

Nevertheless, several key pieces of information are generally required to implement the forwarding table for IP.

* *Destination*: This contains a 32-bit field (or 128-bit field for IPv6) used for matching the result of a masking operation.
+
The destination can be as simple as zero, for a _default route_ covering all destinations, or as long as the full length of an IP address, in the case of a _host route_ that describes only a single destination.

* *Mask*: This contains a 32-bit field (128-bit field for IPv6) applied as a bitwise _AND_ mask to the destination IP address of a datagram being looked up in the _forwarding table_.
+
The masked result is compared with the set of destinations in the _forwarding table entries_.

* *Next-hop*: This contains the 32-bit IPv4 address or 128-bit IPv6 address of the next IP entity (_router_ or _host_) to which the datagram should be sent.
+
The next-hop entity is typically on a network shared with the system performing the forwarding lookup, meaning the two share the same network prefix.

* *Interface*: This contains an identifier used by the IP layer to reference the network interface that should be used to send the datagram to its next hop.
+
For example, it could refer to a host's 802.11 wireless interface, a wired Ethernet interface, or a PPP interface associated with a serial port.
+
If the forwarding system is also the sender of the IP datagram, this field is used in selecting which source IP address to use on the outgoing datagram.

IP forwarding is performed on a *_hop-by-hop_* basis.

* The routers and hosts do not contain the complete forwarding path to any destination.

* IP forwarding provides the IP address of only the next-hop entity to which the datagram is sent.

* It is assumed that the next hop is really _closer_ to the destination than the forwarding system is, and that the next-hop router is directly connected to (i.e., shares a common network prefix with) the forwarding system.

* It is also generally assumed that no _loops_ are constructed between the next hops so that a datagram does not circulate around the network until its _TTL_ or _hop limit_ expires.

=== IP Forwarding Actions

When the IP layer in a host or router needs to send an IP datagram to a next-hop router or host, it first examines the destination IP address (_D_) in the datagram.

Using the value _D_, the following *_longest prefix match algorithm_* is executed on the forwarding table:

. Search the table for all entries for which the following property holds: (_D ^ m~j~_) = _d~j~_,
+
where _m~j~_ is the value of the mask field associated with the forwarding entry _e~j~_ having index _j_,
+
and _d~j~_ is the value of the destination field associated with _e~j~_.
+
If the destination IP address _D_ is bitwise _ANDed_ with the mask in each forwarding table entry (_m~j~_),
+
and the result is compared against the destination in the same forwarding table entry (_d~j~_),
+
the entry (_e~j~_ here) is a match for the destination IP address.
+
When a match happens, the algorithm notes the entry index (_j_ here) and how many bits in the mask _m~j~_ were set to _1_, and the more bits set to _1_, the better the match.

. The best matching entry _e~k~_ (i.e., the one with the largest number of _1_ bits in its mask _m~k~_) is selected, and its next-hop field _n~k~_ is used as the next-hop IP address in forwarding the datagram.

If no matches in the forwarding table are found, the datagram is undeliverable.

* If the undeliverable datagram was generated locally (on this host), a _host unreachable_ error is normally returned to the application that generated the datagram.
* On a router, an _ICMP_ message is normally sent back to the host that sent the datagram.

In some circumstances, more than one entry may match an equal number of _1_ bits.

* This can happen, for example, when more than one default route is available (e.g., when attached to more than one ISP, called _multihoming_).
* The end-system behavior in such cases is not set by standards and is instead specific to the operating system's protocol implementation.
* A common behavior is for the system to simply choose the first match.
* More sophisticated systems may attempt to _load-balance_ or _split traffic_ across the multiple routes.

=== Direct delivery and indirect delivery

Where all systems are using the same network prefix, is called _direct delivery_, and the other case is called _indirect delivery_.

.Direct delivery and indirect delivery
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-protocol/direct-delivery-and-indirect-delivery.png[Direct delivery and indirect delivery,55%,55%]

* Direct delivery does not require the presence of a router—IP datagrams are encapsulated in a link-layer frame that directly identifies the source and destination.
* Indirect delivery involves a router—data is forwarded to the router using the router's link-layer address as the destination link-layer address.

* The router's IP address does not appear in the IP datagram (unless the router itself is the source or destination, or when source routing is used).

In the following table, the destination IPv4 address _D_ (_10.0.0.9_) matches both the first and second forwarding table entries.

* Because it matches the second entry better (_25_ bits instead of none), the _gateway_ or _next-hop_ address is _10.0.0.100_, the address _S_.
* Thus, the gateway portion of the entry contains the address of the sending host's own network interface (no router is referenced), indicating that direct delivery is to be used to send the datagram.

.The (unicast) IPv4 forwarding table at host _S_ contains only two entries.

* Host _S_ is configured with IPv4 address and subnet mask _10.0.0.100/25_.
* Datagrams destined for addresses in the range _10.0.0.1_ through _10.0.0.126_ use the second forwarding table entry and are sent using _direct delivery_.
* All other datagrams use the first entry and are given to router _R_ with IPv4 address _10.0.0.1_.

The datagram is encapsulated in a lower-layer frame destined for the target host _D_.

* If the lower-layer address of the target host is unknown, the _ARP_ protocol (for IPv4) or _Neighbor Solicitation_ (for IPv6) operation may be invoked at this point to determine the correct lower-layer address, _D_.

* Once known, the destination address in the datagram is _D_'s IPv4 address (10.0.0.9), and _D_ is placed in the Destination IP Address field in the lower-layer header.
* The switch delivers the frame to _D_ based solely on the link-layer address _D_; it pays no attention to the IP addresses.

== Mobile IP

*Mobile IP* is based on the idea that a host has a _home_ network but may visit other networks from time to time.

* While at home, ordinary forwarding is performed.

* When away from home, the host keeps the IP address it would ordinarily use at home, but some special _routing_ and _forwarding_ tricks are used to make the host appear to the network, and to the other systems with which it communicates, as though it is attached to its home network.
+
The scheme depends on a special type of router called a _home agent_ that helps provide routing for mobile nodes.

Most of the complexity in *MIPv6* involves signaling messages and how they are secured. These messages use various forms of the Mobility extension header (Next Header field value _135_, often just called the _mobility header_), so Mobile IP is, in effect, a special protocol of its own.

=== The Basic Model for IP Mobility: Bidirectional Tunneling

The following figure shows the entities involved in making _MIPv6_ work. Much of the terminology also applies to _MIPv4_ [RFC5944].

* A host that might move is called a _mobile node_ (MN), and the hosts with which it is communicating are called _correspondent nodes_ (CNs).

* The MN is given an IP address chosen from the network prefix used in its _home network_. This address is known as its _home address_ (HoA).
+
When it travels to a _visited network_, it is given an additional address, called its _care-of-address_ (CoA).

* In the basic model, whenever a CN communicates with an MN, the traffic is routed through the MN's _home agent_ (HA).
+
HAs are a special type of router deployed in the network infrastructure like other important systems (e.g., routers and Web servers).

* The association between an MN's HoA and its CoA is called a _binding_ for the MN.

.Mobile IP supports the ability of nodes to change their point of network attachment and keep network connections operating. The mobile node’s home agent helps to forward traffic for mobiles it serves and also plays a role in route optimization, which can substantially improve routing performance by allowing mobile and correspondent nodes to communicate directly.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-protocol/mobile-ip-model.png[Basic MIPV6 Model,55%,55%]

The basic model works in cases where an MN's CNs do not engage in the MIPv6 protocol. This model is also used for network mobility (called _NEMO_ [RFC3963]), when an entire network is mobile.

* When the MN (or mobile network router) attaches to a new point in the network, it receives its CoA and sends a _binding update_ message to its HA. The HA responds with a _binding acknowledgment_.

* Assuming that all goes well, traffic between the MN and CNs is thereafter routed through the MN's HA using a two-way form of IPv6 packet tunneling[RFC2473] called _bidirectional tunneling_.
+
These messages are ordinarily protected using _IPsec_ with the _Encapsulating Security Payload_ (ESP).
+
Doing so ensures that an HA is not fooled into accepting a binding update from a fake MN.

== Host Processing of IP Datagrams

Although routers do not ordinarily have to consider which IP addresses to place in the _Source IP Address_ and _Destination IP Address_ fields of the packets they forward, hosts must consider both.

* Applications such as Web browsers may attempt to make connections to a named host or server that can have multiple addresses.

* The client system making such connections may also have multiple addresses.

=== Host Models

Although it may appear to be a straightforward decision to determine whether a received unicast datagram matches one of a host's IP addresses and should be processed, this decision depends on the _host model_ of the receiving system [RFC1122] and is most relevant for multihomed hosts.

There are two host models, the *strong host model* and the *weak host model*.

* In the _strong host model_, a datagram is accepted for delivery to the local protocol stack only if the IP address contained in the _Destination IP Address_ field matches one of those configured on the interface upon which the datagram arrived.

* In systems implementing the _weak host model_, the opposite is true—a datagram carrying a destination address matching any of the local addresses may arrive on any interface and is processed by the receiving protocol stack, irrespective of the network interface upon which it arrived.

Host models also apply to sending behavior. That is, a host using the strong host model sends datagrams from a particular interface only if one of the interface's configured addresses matches the _Source IP Address_ field in the datagram being sent.

.Hosts may be connected by more than one interface. In such cases, they must decide which addresses to use for the _Source IP Address_ and _Destination IP Address_ fields of the packets they exchange. The addresses used result from a combination of each host's forwarding table, application of an address selection algorithm [RFC 3484], and whether hosts are operating using a _weak_ or _strong host model_.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-protocol/host-model.png[Host Model,45%,45%]

* In this example, two hosts (A and B) are connected through the global Internet but also through a local network.
* If host A is set up to conform to the _strong host model_, packets it receives destined for _203.0.113.1_ from the Internet or destined for _192.0.2.1_ from the local network are dropped.
* This situation can arise, for example, if host B is configured to obey the _weak host model_.
** It may choose to send packets to _192.0.2.1_ using the local network (e.g., because doing so may be cheaper or faster).
** This situation seems unfortunate, as A receives what appear to be perfectly legitimate packets, yet drops them merely because it is operating according to the strong host model.

The host model, for both sending and receiving behavior, can be configured in some operating systems.

* In Windows (Vista and later), strong host behavior is the default for sending and receiving for IPv4 and IPv6.
* In Linux, the IP behavior defaults to the weak host model.
* BSD (including Mac OS X) uses the strong hostmodel.

In Windows, the following commands can be used to configure weak host receive and send behavior, respectively:

[source,bat]
----
C:\> netsh interface ipvX set interface <ifname> weakhostreceive=Yabled
C:\> netsh interface ipvX set interface <ifname> weakhostsend=Yabled
----

For these commands, _<ifname>_ is replaced with the appropriate interface name; _X_ is replaced with either 4 or 6, depending on which version of IP is being configured; and _Y_ is replaced with either _en_ or _dis_, depending on whether weak behavior is to be enabled or disabled, respectively.
