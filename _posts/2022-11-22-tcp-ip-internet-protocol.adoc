IP is the workhorse protocol of the TCP/IP protocol suite. All TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IGMP data gets transmitted as IP datagrams. IP provides a *_best-effort_*, *_connectionless_* datagram delivery service.

== IPv4 and IPv6 Headers

The normal size of the IPv4 header is 20 bytes, unless _options_ are present (which is rare).

The IPv6 header is twice as large but never has any options, may have _extension headers_.

The most significant bit of headers and datagrams is numbered 0 at the left, and the least significant bit of a 32-bit value is numbered 31 on the right.

* The 4 bytes in a 32-bit value are transmitted in the following order: bits _0–7_ first, then bits _8–15_, then _16–23_, and bits _24–31_ last.
* This is called *big endian byte ordering*, which is the byte ordering required for all binary integers in the TCP/IP headers as they traverse a network. It is also called *network byte order*.
* Computer CPUs that store binary integers in other formats, such as the *little endian* format, must convert the header values into network byte order for transmission and back again for reception.

.The IPv4 datagram format.

* The header is of variable size, limited to fifteen 32-bit words (60 bytes) by the 4-bit _IHL_ field.
* A typical IPv4 header contains 20 bytes (no options).
* The source and destination addresses are 32 bits long.
*  Most of the second 32-bit word is used for the IPv4 _fragmentation_ function.
* A header _checksum_ helps ensure that the fields in the header are delivered correctly to the proper destination but does not protect the data.

.The IPv6 datagram format.

* The IPv6 header is of fixed size (40 bytes) and contains 128-bit _source_ and _destination_ addresses.
* The _Next Header_ field is used to indicate the presence and types of additional extension headers that follow the IPv6 header, forming a _daisy chain of headers_ that may include special extensions or processing directives.
* Application data follows the header chain, usually immediately following a transport-layer header.

=== IP Header Fields

The first field (only 4 bits or one nibble wide) is the _Version_ field.

* It contains the version number of the IP datagram: _4_ for IPv4 and _6_ for IPv6.
* The headers for both IPv4 and IPv6 share the location of the _Version_ field but no others.
* Thus, the two protocols are not directly interoperable—a host or router must handle either IPv4 or IPv6 (or both, called *_dual stack_*) separately.

The _Internet Header Length (IHL)_ field is the number of 32-bit words in the IPv4 header, including any options.

* Because this is also a 4-bit field, the IPv4 header is limited to a maximum of fifteen 32-bit words or 60 bytes.
+
The normal value of this field (when no options are present) is 5.

* There is no such field in IPv6 because the header length is fixed at 40 bytes.

Following the header length, the original specification of IPv4 [RFC0791] specified a _Type of Service (ToS)_ byte, and IPv6 [RFC2460] specified the equivalent _Traffic Class_ byte.

*  Use of these never became widespread, so eventually this 8-bit field was split into two smaller parts and redefined by a set of RFCs ([RFC3260] [RFC3168][RFC2474] and others).

** The first 6 bits are now called the _Differentiated Services_ Field (_DS_ Field), and the last 2 bits are the _Explicit Congestion Notification_ (_ECN_) field or indicator bits.
** These RFCs now apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.
* These fields are used for special processing of the datagram when it is forwarded.

The _Total Length_ field is the total length of the IPv4 datagram in bytes.

* Using this field and the _IHL_ field, we know where the data portion of the datagram starts, and its length.

* Because this is a 16-bit field, the maximum size of an IPv4 datagram (including header) is 65,535 bytes.

* Although it is possible to send a 65,535-byte IP datagram, most link layers (such as Ethernet) are not able to carry one this large without fragmenting it (chopping it up) into smaller pieces.
+
Furthermore, a host is not required to be able to receive an IPv4 datagram larger than _576_ bytes.
+
In IPv6 a host must be able to process a datagram at least as large as the MTU of the link to which it is attached, and the minimum link MTU is _1280_ bytes.
+
When an IPv4 datagram is fragmented into multiple smaller fragments, each of which itself is an independent IP datagram, the _Total Length_ field reflects the length of the particular fragment.
+
In IPv6, fragmentation is not supported by the header, and the length is instead given by the _Payload Length_ field.
+
This field measures the length of the IPv6 datagram not including the length of the header; extension headers, however, are included in the _Payload Length_ field.

The _Identification_ field helps indentify each datagram sent by an IPv4 host.

* To ensure that the fragments of one datagram are not confused with those of another, the sending host normally increments an internal counter by 1 each time a datagram is sent (from one of its IP addresses) and copies the value of the counter into the IPv4 _Identification_ field.

* The _Identification_, _Flags_ and _Fragment Offset_ fields are most important for implementing fragmentation.
+
In IPv6, this field shows up in the _Fragmentation extension header_.

The _Time-to-Live_ field, or _TTL_, sets an upper limit on the number of routers through which a datagram can pass.

* It is initialized by the sender to some value (_64_ is recommended [RFC1122], although _128_ or _255_ is not uncommon) and decremented by _1_ by every router that forwards the datagram.

* When this field reaches _0_, the datagram is thrown away, and the sender is notified with an _ICMP_ message.
+
This prevents packets from getting caught in the network forever should an unwanted routing loop occur.

The _Protocol_ field in the IPv4 header contains a number indicating the type of data found in the payload portion of the datagram.

* The most common values are _17_ (for UDP) and _6_ (for TCP).
* This provides a demultiplexing feature so that the IP protocol can be used to carry payloads of more than one protocol type.
* Although this field originally specified the _transport-layer protocol_ the datagram is encapsulating, it is now understood to identify the encapsulated protocol, which may or not be a transport protocol.
+
For example, other encapsulations are possible, such as _IPv4-in-IPv4_ (value _4_).

* The official list of the possible values of the Protocol field is given in the assigned numbers page [AN].

The _Next Header_ field in the IPv6 header generalizes the _Protocol_ field from IPv4.

* It is used to indicate the type of header following the IPv6 header.

* This field may contain any values defined for the IPv4 _Protocol_ field, or any of the values associated with the IPv6 extension headers.

The _Header Checksum_ field is calculated over the IPv4 header only.

* This is important to understand because it means that the payload of the IPv4 datagram (e.g., TCP or UDP data) is not checked for correctness by the IP protocol. 
* Perhaps surprisingly, the IPv6 header does not have any checksum field.

Every IP datagram contains the _Source IP Address_ of the sender of the datagram and the _Destination IP Address_ of where the datagram is destined.

* These are 32-bit values for IPv4 and 128-bit values for IPv6, and they usually identify a single interface on a computer, although multicast and broadcast addresses  violate this rule.

== IP Forwarding

Conceptually, IP forwarding is simple, especially for a host.

* If the destination is directly connected to the host (e.g., a point-to-point link) or on a shared network (e.g., Ethernet), the IP datagram is sent directly to the destination—a router is not required or used.
* Otherwise, the host sends the datagram to a single router (called the _default router_) and lets the router deliver the datagram to its destination.
