== What are Control Groups

Linux Control Groups (*cgroups*) enable limits on the use of system hardware, ensuring that an individual process running inside a cgroup only utilizes as much as has been allowed in the cgroups configuration.

Control Groups restrict the volume of usage on a resource that has been enabled by a *namespace*.

Control Group Namespaces provide a virtualized view of individual cgroups through the `/proc/self/ns/cgroup` interface.

The purpose is to prevent leakage of privileged data from the *global namespaces* to the cgroup and to enable other features, such as container migration.

Because it is now much easier to associate a *container* with a single cgroup, containers have a much more coherent cgroup view, it also enables tasks inside the container to have a virtualized view of the cgroup it belongs to.

**Namespace**s are a kernel feature that allow a virtual view of isolated system resources. By isolating a process from system resources, you can specify and control what a process is able to interact with. Namespaces are an essential part of Control Groups.

* *Mount*
+
The mount namespace isolates file system mount points, enabling each process to have a distinct filesystem space within wich to operate. 

* *UTS*
+
Hostname and NIS domain name 

* *IPC*
+
System V IPC, POSIX message queues 

* *PID*
+
Process IDs 

* *Network*
+
Network devices, stacks, ports, etc. 

* *User*
+
User and group IDs 

* *Control Groups*
+
Isolates cgroups 

A *resource controller*, also called a *cgroup subsystem*, represents a single resource, such as CPU time or memory. The Linux kernel provides a range of resource controllers, that are mounted automatically by systemd.

* *blkio* — sets limits on input/output access to and from block devices;
* *cpu* — uses the CPU scheduler to provide cgroup tasks access to the CPU. It is mounted together with the `cpuacct` controller on the same mount;
* *cpuacct* — creates automatic reports on CPU resources used by tasks in a cgroup. It is mounted together with the `cpu` controller on the same mount;
* *cpuset* — assigns individual CPUs (on a multicore system) and memory nodes to tasks in a cgroup;
* *devices* — allows or denies access to devices for tasks in a cgroup;
* *freezer* — suspends or resumes tasks in a cgroup;
* *memory* — sets limits on memory use by tasks in a cgroup and generates automatic reports on memory resources used by those tasks;
* *net_cls* — tags network packets with a class identifier (*classid*) that allows the Linux traffic controller (the `tc` command) to identify packets originating from a particular cgroup task. A subsystem of `net_cls`, the `net_filter` (`iptables`) can also use this tag to perform actions on such packets. The `net_filter` tags network sockets with a firewall identifier (*fwid*) that allows the Linux firewall (the `iptables` command) to identify packets (skb->sk) originating from a particular cgroup task;
* *perf_event* — enables monitoring cgroups with the *perf* tool;
* *hugetlb* — allows to use virtual memory pages of large sizes and to enforce resource limits on these pages. 

=== How Control Groups are Organized

Cgroups are organized hierarchically, like processes, and child cgroups inherit some of the attributes of their parents. However, there are differences between the two models.

* The Linux Process Model
+
All processes on a Linux system are child processes of a common parent: the `init` process, which is executed by the kernel at boot time and starts other processes (which may in turn start child processes of their own). Because all processes descend from a single parent, the Linux process model is a single hierarchy, or tree.
+
Additionally, every Linux process except init inherits the environment (such as the PATH variable) and certain other attributes (such as open file descriptors) of its parent process.

* The Cgroup Model
+
Cgroups are similar to processes in that:
+
--
** they are hierarchical, and
** child cgroups inherit certain attributes from their parent cgroup. 
--
+
The fundamental difference is that many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a system. If the Linux process model is a single tree of processes, then the cgroup model is one or more separate, unconnected trees of tasks (i.e. processes).
+
Multiple separate hierarchies of cgroups are necessary because each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems.

Remember that system *processes* are called *tasks* in *cgroup* terminology.

Here are a few simple rules governing the relationships between subsystems, hierarchies of cgroups, and tasks, along with explanations of the consequences of those rules.

* *Rule 1*
+
A single hierarchy can have one or more subsystems attached to it.
+
_As a consequence, the `cpu` and `memory` subsystems (or any number of subsystems) can be attached to a single hierarchy, as long as each one is not attached to any other hierarchy which has any other subsystems attached to it already (see Rule 2)._
+
image::{rmg-rule1-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 2*
+
Any single subsystem (such as `cpu`) cannot be attached to more than one hierarchy if one of those hierarchies has a different subsystem attached to it already.
+
_As a consequence, the `cpu` subsystem can never be attached to two different hierarchies if one of those hierarchies already has the `memory` subsystem attached to it. However, a single subsystem can be attached to two hierarchies if both of those hierarchies have only that subsystem attached._
+
image::{rmg-rule2-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 3*
+
Each time a new hierarchy is created on the systems, all tasks on the system are initially members of the default cgroup of that hierarchy, which is known as the *root cgroup*. For any single hierarchy you create, each task on the system can be a member of exactly one cgroup in that hierarchy.
+
A single task may be in multiple cgroups, as long as each of those cgroups is in a different hierarchy.
+
As soon as a task becomes a member of a second cgroup in the same hierarchy, it is removed from the first cgroup in that hierarchy. At no time is a task ever in two different cgroups in the same hierarchy.
+
_As a consequence, if the `cpu` and `memory` subsystems are attached to a hierarchy named `cpu_mem_cg`, and the `net_cls` subsystem is attached to a hierarchy named `net`, then a running `httpd` process could be a member of any one cgroup in `cpu_mem_cg`, and any one cgroup in `net`._
+
The cgroup in `cpu_mem_cg` that the `httpd` process is a member of might restrict its CPU time to half of that allotted to other processes, and limit its memory usage to a maximum of `1024` MB. Additionally, the cgroup in `net` that the `httpd` process is a member of might limit its transmission rate to `30` MB/s (megabytes per second).
+
When the first hierarchy is created, every task on the system is a member of at least one cgroup: the root cgroup. When using cgroups, therefore, every system task is always in at least one cgroup. 
+
image::{rmg-rule3-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 4*
+
Any process (task) on the system which forks itself creates a child task. A child task automatically inherits the cgroup membership of its parent but can be moved to different cgroups as needed. Once forked, the parent and child processes are completely independent.
+
_As a consequence, consider the `httpd` task that is a member of the cgroup named `half_cpu_1gb_max` in the `cpu_and_mem` hierarchy, and a member of the cgroup `trans_rate_30` in the `net` hierarchy. When that `httpd` process forks itself, its child process automatically becomes a member of the `half_cpu_1gb_max` cgroup, and the `trans_rate_30` cgroup. It inherits the exact same cgroups its parent task belongs to._
+
_From that point forward, the parent and child tasks are completely independent of each other: changing the cgroups that one task belongs to does not affect the other. Neither will changing cgroups of a parent task affect any of its grandchildren in any way. To summarize: any child task always initially inherits memberships to the exact same cgroups as their parent task, but those memberships can be changed or removed later._

=== Introduction to systemd

*Systemd* is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic.

|===

By default, *systemd* automatically creates a hierarchy of `slice`, `scope` and `service` units to provide a unified structure for the cgroup tree. Also, systemd automatically mounts hierarchies for important kernel **resource controller**s in the `/sys/fs/cgroup/` directory. 

* *Service* — A process or a group of processes, which `systemd` started based on a unit configuration file. Services encapsulate the specified processes so that they can be started and stopped as one set.

* *Scope* — A group of externally created processes. Scopes encapsulate processes that are started and stopped by arbitrary processes through the `fork()` function and then registered by systemd at runtime. For instance, user sessions, containers, and virtual machines are treated as scopes.

* *Slice* — A group of hierarchically organized units. Slices do not contain processes, they organize a hierarchy in which scopes and services are placed. The actual processes are contained in scopes or in services. In this hierarchical tree, every name of a slice unit corresponds to the path to a location in the hierarchy. The dash ("-") character acts as a separator of the path components.

Use the `systemctl` command to list system units and to view their status. Also, the `systemd-cgls` command is provided to view the hierarchy of control groups and `systemd-cgtop` to monitor their resource consumption in real time. 

Use the following command to list all active units on the system:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl list-units

The `list-units` option is executed by default, which means that you will receive the same output when you omit this option.

To list all unit files installed on your system and their status, type:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl list-unit-files

To view a list of all slices used on the system, type:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl -t slice 

[source,console]
----
  UNIT                  LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION
  -.slice               loaded active active Root Slice

  user-1000.slice       loaded active active User Slice of UID 1000
  user.slice            loaded active active User and Session Slice

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.
6 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

To display detailed information about a service unit that corresponds to a system service, type: 

[source,sh]
----
$ systemctl status ssh.service 
----

[source,console,highlight=11]

To display the whole cgroup hierarchy on your system, type:

[source,sh]
----
$ systemd-cgls
----

When `systemd-cgls` is issued without parameters, it returns the entire cgroup hierarchy. 

To view it information is stored in dedicated process files, type as root:

[source,sh]
$ cat proc/PID/cgroup

Where `PID` stands for the ID of the process you wish to examine.

The *systemd-cgls* command provides a static snapshot of the cgroup hierarchy. To see a dynamic account of currently running cgroups ordered by their resource usage (CPU, Memory, and IO), use:

[source,sh]
$ systemd-cgtop

=== Using libcgroup Tools

In order to use libcgroup tools, first ensure the cgroup-tools packages are installed on your system. 

[source,sh]
$ sudo apt-get install cgroup-tools -y

[source,console]
----
$ dpkg -l | grep cgroup-tools
ii  cgroup-tools                    0.41-8.1                     amd64        control and monitor control groups (tools)
----

[NOTE] 
====
The `cgroup-tools` with version `0.41-8.1` does not work with *cgroup2*.

[source,console]
----
$ uname -r
5.10.0-9-amd64

$ mount -t cgroup2,cgroup
cgroup2 on /sys/fs/cgroup type cgroup2 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate,memory_recursiveprot)

$ cgget -g cpuset /
cgget: libcgroup initialization failed: Cgroup is not mounted
----
====

* Finding a Process
+
To find the cgroup to which a process belongs, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ ps -O cgroup
+
[source,console]
----
$ ps -o pid,cgroup:60,command
   PID CGROUP                                                       COMMAND
  5345 10:memory:/user.slice/user-1001.slice/session-21.scope,9:dev -bash
  5441 10:memory:/user.slice/user-1001.slice/session-21.scope,9:dev ps -o pid,cgroup:60,command
----
+
Or, if you know the PID for the process, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ cat /proc/PID/cgroup
+
where `PID` stands for a ID of the inspected process. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cat /proc/5345/cgroup

----

* Listing Controllers
+
To find the controllers that are available in your kernel and information on how they are mounted together to hierarchies, execute:
+
[source,sh]
$ cat /proc/cgroups
+
[source,console]
----
#subsys_name	hierarchy	num_cgroups	enabled
cpuset	4	68	1
cpu	3	277	1
cpuacct	3	277	1
memory	6	277	1
devices	8	277	1
freezer	11	68	1
net_cls	10	68	1
blkio	5	277	1
perf_event	2	68	1
hugetlb	7	68	1
pids	9	277	1
net_prio	10	68	1
----
+
Alternatively, to find the mount points of particular subsystems, execute the following command:
+
[source,sh]
$ lssubsys -m [controllers]
+
Here `controllers` stands for a list of the subsystems seperated with space in which you are interested.
+
[source,console]
----
$ lssubsys -m
cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpu,cpuacct /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct
memory /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
devices /sys/fs/cgroup/devices
freezer /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer
net_cls,net_prio /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio
blkio /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
perf_event /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event
hugetlb /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb
pids /sys/fs/cgroup/pids

$ lssubsys -m cpu memory
cpu,cpuacct /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct
memory /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
----

* Finding Hierarchies
+
It is recommended that you mount hierarchies under the `/sys/fs/cgroup/` directory. Assuming this is the case on your system, list or browse the contents of that directory to obtain a list of hierarchies. If the tree utility is installed on your system, run it to obtain an overview of all hierarchies and the cgroups within them:
+
[source,sh]
$ tree /sys/fs/cgroup
+
[source,console]
----
$ tree -L 1 /sys/fs/cgroup/
/sys/fs/cgroup/
├── blkio
├── cpu -> cpu,cpuacct
├── cpuacct -> cpu,cpuacct
├── cpu,cpuacct
├── cpuset
├── devices
├── freezer
├── hugetlb
├── memory
├── net_cls -> net_cls,net_prio
├── net_cls,net_prio
├── net_prio -> net_cls,net_prio
├── perf_event
├── pids
└── systemd
----

* Finding Control Groups
+
To list the cgroups on a system, execute as root:
+
[source,sh]
$ lscgroup
+
To restrict the output to a specific hierarchy, specify a controller and a path in the format `controller:path`. For example:
+
[source,sh]
$ lscgroup cpuset:adminusers
+
The above command lists only subgroups of the `adminusers` cgroup in the hierarchy to which the `cpuset` controller is attached. 

* Displaying Parameters of Control Groups
+
To display the parameters of specific cgroups, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -r parameter list_of_cgroups
+
where `parameter` is a pseudofile that contains values for a controller, and `list_of_cgroups` is a list of cgroups separated with spaces. For example:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -r cpuset.cpus -r memory.limit_in_bytes group1 group2
+
displays the values of `cpuset.cpus` and `memory.limit_in_bytes` for cgroups `group1` and `group2`.
+
If you do not know the names of the parameters themselves, use a command like:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -g cpuset /

== What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. 

=== Containers vs. VMs

You might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with access to the underlying hardware. Containers are often compared to virtual machines (VMs). Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services.

* Containers are much more lightweight than VMs
* Containers virtualize at the OS level while VMs virtualize at the hardware level
* Containers share the OS kernel and use a fraction of the memory VMs require

=== What is Docker? 

The word "Docker" refers to several things, including an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that primarily supports that project; and the tools that company formally supports. 

With Docker, you can treat containers like extremely lightweight, modular virtual machines.

The Docker technology uses the https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel[Linux kernel] and features of the kernel, like https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-rhel-8-welcome-cgroups-v2[*Cgroups*] and https://lwn.net/Articles/528078/[*namespaces*], to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence is the intention of containers—the ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another to make better use of your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have with separate systems.

=== What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

image::https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/kubernetes_diagram-v3-770x717_0_0_v2.svg?[,55%,55%]

With Kubernetes you can:

* Orchestrate containers across multiple hosts.
* Make better use of hardware to maximize resources needed to run your enterprise apps.
* Control and automate application deployments and updates.
* Mount and add storage to run stateful apps.
* Scale containerized applications and their resources on the fly.
* Declaratively manage services, which guarantees the deployed applications are always running the way you intended them to run.
* Health-check and self-heal your apps with autoplacement, autorestart, autoreplication, and autoscaling.

== Manage containers in namespaces by using nsenter

The kernel allocates and restricts the resources for individual processes running on the Linux operating system. The namespaces within the kernel partition these resources. Namespaces allocate the resources to a process such that the process only sees those specific resources. Namespaces provide isolation among the process, managing what system resources they can see. This technology is widely-used in container runtimes to provide a layer of isolation among containers that run on the same host.

Use Docker to create a container from the `debian:bullseye` image and install `procps` package inside the container, which provides `top` and `ps` commands.

[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it --name namespace-demo -it debian:bullseye /bin/bash

      1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    481 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
----

In another terminal, use the `docker inspect` command to determine the process id associated with the new container.

[source,console]
----
$ docker inspect namespace-demo -f "{{.State.Pid}}"
415111
----

The process id is *415111*.

Each process has a */proc/[pid]/ns/* subdirectory containing one entry for each namespace that supports being manipulated by https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html[setns].

Use the `ls` or `lsns` command to list the namespaces associated with a given process.

The `nsenter` command expands to namespace enter. It accepts different options to only enter the specified namespace.

Let's enter the network namespace to check the IP address and route table.

[source,console]
----
$ nsenter -t 415111 -n ip a s
nsenter: cannot open /proc/415111/ns/net: Permission denied

$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -n ip a s
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
19: eth0@if20: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

Here, `-t` is the target process id, and `-n` refers to the network namespace.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -n ip route
default via 172.17.0.1 dev eth0 
172.17.0.0/16 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.2 
----

Next, I enter the process namespace to check the process details.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -p -r ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 04:00 pts/0    00:00:00 /bin/bash
root         489       0  0 04:44 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
----

The `-r` option sets the root directory to the top-level directory within the namespace so that the commands run in the context of the namespace.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -p -r top

----

The `bash` command, which executes during `docker run`, is the first process inside the namespace.

Enter the UTC namespace to check the hostname.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -u hostname
5153317a7aa2
----

Modify the hostname within the namespace and verify the new name.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -u hostname foo.bar.buzz

$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -u hostname
foo.bar.buzz
----

Finally, enter all namespaces by using the `-a` option.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nsenter -t 415111 -a lsns
