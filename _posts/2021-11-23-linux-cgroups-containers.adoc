== What are Control Groups

Linux Control Groups (*cgroups*) enable limits on the use of system hardware, ensuring that an individual process running inside a cgroup only utilizes as much as has been allowed in the cgroups configuration.

Control Groups restrict the volume of usage on a resource that has been enabled by a *namespace*.

Control Group Namespaces provide a virtualized view of individual cgroups through the `/proc/self/ns/cgroup` interface.

The purpose is to prevent leakage of privileged data from the *global namespaces* to the cgroup and to enable other features, such as container migration.

Because it is now much easier to associate a *container* with a single cgroup, containers have a much more coherent cgroup view, it also enables tasks inside the container to have a virtualized view of the cgroup it belongs to.

=== What are Namespaces

**Namespace**s are a kernel feature that allow a virtual view of isolated system resources. By isolating a process from system resources, you can specify and control what a process is able to interact with.

Namespaces are an essential part of Control Groups.

* *Mount*
+
The mount namespace isolates file system mount points, enabling each process to have a distinct filesystem space within wich to operate. 

* *UTS*
+
Hostname and NIS domain name 

* *IPC*
+
System V IPC, POSIX message queues 

* *PID*
+
Process IDs 

* *Network*
+
Network devices, stacks, ports, etc. 

* *User*
+
User and group IDs 

* *Control Groups*
+
Isolates cgroups 

=== What are Resource Controllers

A *resource controller*, also called a *cgroup subsystem*, represents a single resource, such as CPU time or memory. The Linux kernel provides a range of resource controllers, that are mounted automatically by systemd.

* *blkio* — sets limits on input/output access to and from block devices;
* *cpu* — uses the CPU scheduler to provide cgroup tasks access to the CPU. It is mounted together with the `cpuacct` controller on the same mount;
* *cpuacct* — creates automatic reports on CPU resources used by tasks in a cgroup. It is mounted together with the `cpu` controller on the same mount;
* *cpuset* — assigns individual CPUs (on a multicore system) and memory nodes to tasks in a cgroup;
* *devices* — allows or denies access to devices for tasks in a cgroup;
* *freezer* — suspends or resumes tasks in a cgroup;
* *memory* — sets limits on memory use by tasks in a cgroup and generates automatic reports on memory resources used by those tasks;
* *net_cls* — tags network packets with a class identifier (*classid*) that allows the Linux traffic controller (the `tc` command) to identify packets originating from a particular cgroup task. A subsystem of `net_cls`, the `net_filter` (`iptables`) can also use this tag to perform actions on such packets. The `net_filter` tags network sockets with a firewall identifier (*fwid*) that allows the Linux firewall (the `iptables` command) to identify packets (skb->sk) originating from a particular cgroup task;
* *perf_event* — enables monitoring cgroups with the *perf* tool;
* *hugetlb* — allows to use virtual memory pages of large sizes and to enforce resource limits on these pages. 

=== How Control Groups are Organized

Cgroups are organized hierarchically, like processes, and child cgroups inherit some of the attributes of their parents. However, there are differences between the two models.

* The Linux Process Model
+
All processes on a Linux system are child processes of a common parent: the `init` process, which is executed by the kernel at boot time and starts other processes (which may in turn start child processes of their own). Because all processes descend from a single parent, the Linux process model is a single hierarchy, or tree.
+
Additionally, every Linux process except init inherits the environment (such as the PATH variable) and certain other attributes (such as open file descriptors) of its parent process.

* The Cgroup Model
+
Cgroups are similar to processes in that:
+
--
** they are hierarchical, and
** child cgroups inherit certain attributes from their parent cgroup. 
--
+
The fundamental difference is that many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a system. If the Linux process model is a single tree of processes, then the cgroup model is one or more separate, unconnected trees of tasks (i.e. processes).
+
Multiple separate hierarchies of cgroups are necessary because each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems.

Remember that system *processes* are called *tasks* in *cgroup* terminology.

Here are a few simple rules governing the relationships between subsystems, hierarchies of cgroups, and tasks, along with explanations of the consequences of those rules.

* *Rule 1*
+
A single hierarchy can have one or more subsystems attached to it.
+
_As a consequence, the `cpu` and `memory` subsystems (or any number of subsystems) can be attached to a single hierarchy, as long as each one is not attached to any other hierarchy which has any other subsystems attached to it already (see Rule 2)._
+
image::{rmg-rule1-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 2*
+
Any single subsystem (such as `cpu`) cannot be attached to more than one hierarchy if one of those hierarchies has a different subsystem attached to it already.
+
_As a consequence, the `cpu` subsystem can never be attached to two different hierarchies if one of those hierarchies already has the `memory` subsystem attached to it. However, a single subsystem can be attached to two hierarchies if both of those hierarchies have only that subsystem attached._
+
image::{rmg-rule2-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 3*
+
Each time a new hierarchy is created on the systems, all tasks on the system are initially members of the default cgroup of that hierarchy, which is known as the *root cgroup*. For any single hierarchy you create, each task on the system can be a member of exactly one cgroup in that hierarchy.
+
A single task may be in multiple cgroups, as long as each of those cgroups is in a different hierarchy.
+
As soon as a task becomes a member of a second cgroup in the same hierarchy, it is removed from the first cgroup in that hierarchy. At no time is a task ever in two different cgroups in the same hierarchy.
+
_As a consequence, if the `cpu` and `memory` subsystems are attached to a hierarchy named `cpu_mem_cg`, and the `net_cls` subsystem is attached to a hierarchy named `net`, then a running `httpd` process could be a member of any one cgroup in `cpu_mem_cg`, and any one cgroup in `net`._
+
The cgroup in `cpu_mem_cg` that the `httpd` process is a member of might restrict its CPU time to half of that allotted to other processes, and limit its memory usage to a maximum of `1024` MB. Additionally, the cgroup in `net` that the `httpd` process is a member of might limit its transmission rate to `30` MB/s (megabytes per second).
+
When the first hierarchy is created, every task on the system is a member of at least one cgroup: the root cgroup. When using cgroups, therefore, every system task is always in at least one cgroup. 
+
image::{rmg-rule3-png}[,55%,55%]

* *Rule 4*
+
Any process (task) on the system which forks itself creates a child task. A child task automatically inherits the cgroup membership of its parent but can be moved to different cgroups as needed. Once forked, the parent and child processes are completely independent.
+
_As a consequence, consider the `httpd` task that is a member of the cgroup named `half_cpu_1gb_max` in the `cpu_and_mem` hierarchy, and a member of the cgroup `trans_rate_30` in the `net` hierarchy. When that `httpd` process forks itself, its child process automatically becomes a member of the `half_cpu_1gb_max` cgroup, and the `trans_rate_30` cgroup. It inherits the exact same cgroups its parent task belongs to._
+
_From that point forward, the parent and child tasks are completely independent of each other: changing the cgroups that one task belongs to does not affect the other. Neither will changing cgroups of a parent task affect any of its grandchildren in any way. To summarize: any child task always initially inherits memberships to the exact same cgroups as their parent task, but those memberships can be changed or removed later._

=== systemd

*Systemd* is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic.

By default, *systemd* automatically creates a hierarchy of `slice`, `scope` and `service` units to provide a unified structure for the cgroup tree. Also, systemd automatically mounts hierarchies for important kernel **resource controller**s in the `/sys/fs/cgroup/` directory. 

* *Service* — A process or a group of processes, which `systemd` started based on a unit configuration file. Services encapsulate the specified processes so that they can be started and stopped as one set.

* *Scope* — A group of externally created processes. Scopes encapsulate processes that are started and stopped by arbitrary processes through the `fork()` function and then registered by systemd at runtime. For instance, user sessions, containers, and virtual machines are treated as scopes.

* *Slice* — A group of hierarchically organized units. Slices do not contain processes, they organize a hierarchy in which scopes and services are placed. The actual processes are contained in scopes or in services. In this hierarchical tree, every name of a slice unit corresponds to the path to a location in the hierarchy. The dash ("-") character acts as a separator of the path components.

Use the `systemctl` command to list system units and to view their status. Also, the `systemd-cgls` command is provided to view the hierarchy of control groups and `systemd-cgtop` to monitor their resource consumption in real time. 

Use the following command to list all active units on the system:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl list-units

The `list-units` option is executed by default, which means that you will receive the same output when you omit this option.

To list all unit files installed on your system and their status, type:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl list-unit-files

To view a list of all slices used on the system, type:

[source,sh]
$ systemctl -t slice 

[source,console]

When `systemd-cgls` is issued without parameters, it returns the entire cgroup hierarchy. 

To view theinformation that stored in dedicated process files, type as root:

[source,sh]
$ cat proc/PID/cgroup

Where `PID` stands for the ID of the process you wish to examine.

The *systemd-cgls* command provides a static snapshot of the cgroup hierarchy. To see a dynamic account of currently running cgroups ordered by their resource usage (CPU, Memory, and IO), use:

[source,sh]
$ systemd-cgtop

=== libcgroup

In order to use https://github.com/libcgroup/libcgroup[libcgroup] tools, first ensure the cgroup-tools packages are installed on your system. 

[source,sh]
$ sudo apt-get install cgroup-tools -y

[source,console]
----
$ dpkg -l | grep cgroup-tools

----

[NOTE] 
====
The `cgroup-tools` with version `0.41-8.1` does not work with Cgroup v2.

*Cgroup v2* is the next version of the cgroup Linux API. Differently than cgroup v1, there is a single hierarchy instead of a different one for each controller.

[source,console]
----
$ uname -r

To find the cgroup to which a process belongs, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ ps -O cgroup
+
[source,console]
----
$ ps -o pid,cgroup:60,command
   PID CGROUP                                                       COMMAND

----
+
Or, if you know the PID for the process, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ cat /proc/PID/cgroup
+
where `PID` stands for a ID of the inspected process.

----

* Listing Controllers
+
To find the controllers that are available in your kernel and information on how they are mounted together to hierarchies, execute:
+
[source,sh]
$ cat /proc/cgroups
+
[source,console]
----
#subsys_name	hierarchy	num_cgroups	enabled
cpuset	4	68	1
cpu	3	277	1

blkio	5	277	1
perf_event	2	68	1
hugetlb	7	68	1
pids	9	277	1
net_prio	10	68	1
----
+
Alternatively, to find the mount points of particular subsystems, execute the following command:
+
[source,sh]
$ lssubsys -m [controllers]
+
Here `controllers` stands for a list of the subsystems seperated with space in which you are interested.
+
[source,console]
----
$ lssubsys -m
cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpu,cpuacct /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct
memory /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
devices /sys/fs/cgroup/devices
freezer /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer
net_cls,net_prio /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio
blkio /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
perf_event /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event
hugetlb /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb
pids /sys/fs/cgroup/pids

$ lssubsys -m cpu memory
cpu,cpuacct /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct
memory /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
----

* Finding Hierarchies
+
It is recommended that you mount hierarchies under the `/sys/fs/cgroup/` directory. Assuming this is the case on your system, list or browse the contents of that directory to obtain a list of hierarchies. If the tree utility is installed on your system, run it to obtain an overview of all hierarchies and the cgroups within them:
+
[source,sh]
$ tree /sys/fs/cgroup
+
[source,console]
----
$ tree -L 1 /sys/fs/cgroup/
/sys/fs/cgroup/
├── blkio
├── cpu -> cpu,cpuacct
├── cpuacct -> cpu,cpuacct
├── cpu,cpuacct
├── cpuset
├── devices
├── freezer
├── hugetlb
├── memory
├── net_cls -> net_cls,net_prio
├── net_cls,net_prio
├── net_prio -> net_cls,net_prio
├── perf_event
├── pids
└── systemd
----

* Finding Control Groups
+
To list the cgroups on a system, execute as root:
+
[source,sh]
$ lscgroup
+
To restrict the output to a specific hierarchy, specify a controller and a path in the format `controller:path`. For example:
+
[source,sh]
$ lscgroup cpuset:adminusers
+
The above command lists only subgroups of the `adminusers` cgroup in the hierarchy to which the `cpuset` controller is attached. 

* Displaying Parameters of Control Groups
+
To display the parameters of specific cgroups, run:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -r parameter list_of_cgroups
+
where `parameter` is a pseudofile that contains values for a controller, and `list_of_cgroups` is a list of cgroups separated with spaces. For example:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -r cpuset.cpus -r memory.limit_in_bytes group1 group2
+
displays the values of `cpuset.cpus` and `memory.limit_in_bytes` for cgroups `group1` and `group2`.
+
If you do not know the names of the parameters themselves, use a command like:
+
[source,sh]
$ cgget -g cpuset /

=== nsenter

The kernel allocates and restricts the resources for individual processes running on the Linux operating system. The namespaces within the kernel partition these resources. Namespaces allocate the resources to a process such that the process only sees those specific resources. Namespaces provide isolation among the process, managing what system resources they can see. This technology is widely-used in container runtimes to provide a layer of isolation among containers that run on the same host.

Use Docker to create a container from the `debian:bullseye` image and install `procps` package inside the container, which provides `top` and `ps` commands.

[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it --name namespace-demo -it debian:bullseye /bin/bash

=== free

`free` is a popular command used by system administrators on Unix/Linux platforms. It's a powerful tool that gives insight into the memory usage in human-readable format.

The `man` page for this command states that `free` displays the total amount of free and used memory on the system, including physical and swap space, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel. The information is gathered by parsing *`/proc/meminfo`*.

== What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. 

=== Containers vs. VMs

You might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with access to the underlying hardware. Containers are often compared to virtual machines (VMs). Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services.

* Containers are much more lightweight than VMs
* Containers virtualize at the OS level while VMs virtualize at the hardware level
* Containers share the OS kernel and use a fraction of the memory VMs require

=== Open Container Initiative

The https://opencontainers.org/[*Open Container Initiative*] (*OCI*) is a lightweight, open governance structure (project), formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime. The OCI was launched on June 22nd 2015 by Docker, CoreOS and other leaders in the container industry

The OCI currently contains two specifications: the *Runtime Specification* (runtime-spec) and the *Image Specification* (image-spec). The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a “filesystem bundle” that is unpacked on disk. At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle. At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.

Docker is donating its container format and runtime, runC, to the OCI to serve as the cornerstone of this new effort.

* runc
+
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc[*runc*] is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification.
+

* containerd
+
https://github.com/containerd/containerd[*containerd*] is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. It manages the complete container lifecycle of its host system, from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision to low-level storage to network attachments and beyond.
+
Containerd is built on top of the Open Container Initiative’s *runC* and specification. Containerd is a daemon providing a GRPC API to manage containers on the local system. Containerd leverages runC to provide advanced functionality like checkpoint and restore, seccomp, and user namespace support which will open the door for these features into Docker.
+
Containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.
+
Containerd was designed to be used by Docker and Kubernetes as well as any other container platform that wants to abstract away syscalls or OS specific functionality to run containers on linux, windows, solaris, or other OSes.  

=== What is Docker? 

The word "Docker" refers to several things, including an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that primarily supports that project; and the tools that company formally supports. 

image::https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2018-11/docker-containerized-and-vm-transparent-bg.png[,70%,70%]

With Docker, you can treat containers like extremely lightweight, modular virtual machines.

The Docker technology uses the https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel[Linux kernel] and features of the kernel, like https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-rhel-8-welcome-cgroups-v2[*Cgroups*] and https://lwn.net/Articles/528078/[*namespaces*], to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence is the intention of containers—the ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another to make better use of your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have with separate systems.

=== What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

image::https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/kubernetes_diagram-v3-770x717_0_0_v2.svg?[,55%,55%]

With Kubernetes you can:

* Orchestrate containers across multiple hosts.
* Make better use of hardware to maximize resources needed to run your enterprise apps.
* Control and automate application deployments and updates.
* Mount and add storage to run stateful apps.
* Scale containerized applications and their resources on the fly.
* Declaratively manage services, which guarantees the deployed applications are always running the way you intended them to run.
* Health-check and self-heal your apps with autoplacement, autorestart, autoreplication, and autoscaling.

==== Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

At the lowest layers of a Kubernetes node is the software that, among other things, starts and stops containers. We call this the “Container Runtime”. The most widely known container runtime is Docker, but it is not alone in this space. In fact, the container runtime space has been rapidly evolving. As part of the effort to make Kubernetes more extensible, we've been working on a new plugin API for container runtimes in Kubernetes, called "CRI".

*CRI* (Container Runtime Interface) consists of a specifications/requirements (to-be-added), protobuf API, and libraries for container runtimes to integrate with *kubelet* on a node.

Kubelet communicates with the container runtime (or a CRI shim for the runtime) over Unix sockets using the gRPC framework, where kubelet acts as a client and the CRI shim as the server.

image::https://cl.ly/3I2p0D1V0T26/Image%202016-12-19%20at%2017.13.16.png[,55%,55%]

Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: https://docs.docker.com/engine/[Docker], https://containerd.io/docs/[containerd], https://cri-o.io/#what-is-cri-o[CRI-O], and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

==== What is dockershim

Just as Kubernetes started out with built-in support for Docker Engine, it also included built-in support for various storage volume solutions, network solutions, and even cloud providers. But maintaining these things on an ongoing basis became too cumbersome, so the community decided to strip all third party solutions out of the core, creating the relevant interfaces, such as:

* Container Runtime Interface (*CRI*)
* Container Network Interface (*CNI*)
* Container Storage Interface (*CSI*)

The idea was that any vendor could create a product that automatically interfaces with Kubernetes, as long as it is compliant with these interfaces.

That doesn’t mean that non-compliant components can’t be used with Kubernetes; Kubernetes can do anything with the right components. It just means that non-compliant components need a “shim”, which translates between the component and the relevant Kubernetes interface. For example, *dockershim* takes CRI commands and translates them into something Docker Engine understands, and vice versa. But with the drive to take third-party components like this out of the Kubernetes core, dockershim had to be removed.

image::https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6b4290afef76cad8a084292cd1b5e468e31c9bb3/c26ce/images/blog/2018-05-24-kubernetes-containerd-integration-goes-ga/cri-containerd.png[,75%,75%]

The Kubernetes project plans to deprecate https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md#deprecation[Docker Engine support] in the kubelet and support for dockershim will be removed in a future release announced as a part of the Kubernetes v1.20 release.

==== Debugging Kubernetes nodes with crictl

*crictl* is a command-line interface for CRI-compatible container runtimes. You can use it to inspect and debug container runtimes and applications on a Kubernetes node. crictl and its source are hosted in the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools[cri-tools] repository.

The `crictl` command has several subcommands and runtime flags. Use `crictl help` or `crictl <subcommand> help` for more details.

`crictl` connects to `unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock` by default. For other runtimes, you can set the endpoint in multiple different ways:

* By setting flags `--runtime-endpoint` and `--image-endpoint`
* By setting environment variables `CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT` and `IMAGE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`
* By setting the endpoint in the config file `--config=/etc/crictl.yaml`

You can also specify timeout values when connecting to the server and enable or disable debugging, by specifying `timeout` or `debug` values in the configuration file or using the `--timeout` and `--debug` command-line flags.

To view or edit the current configuration, view or edit the contents of `/etc/crictl.yaml`.

[source,console]
----
cat /etc/crictl.yaml
runtime-endpoint: unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock
image-endpoint: unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock
timeout: 10
debug: true
----

WARNING: If you use `crictl` to create pod sandboxes or containers on a running Kubernetes cluster, the Kubelet will eventually delete them. `crictl` is not a general purpose workflow tool, but a tool that is useful for debugging.

* Run a pod sandbox
+
Using `crictl` to run a pod sandbox is useful for debugging container runtimes. On a running Kubernetes cluster, the sandbox will eventually be stopped and deleted by the Kubelet.
+
--
** Create a JSON file like the following:
+
.pod-config.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "nginx-sandbox",
    "namespace": "default",
    "attempt": 1,
    "uid": "hdishd83djaidwnduwk28bcsb"
  },
  "log_directory": "/tmp",
  "linux": {
  }
}
----
+
** Use the `crictl runp` command to apply the JSON and run the sandbox.
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo crictl runp pod-config.json
7a42c484476cd008df5730df0cbbd679c72ac57b7d16b82d40917ed5ffe20ada
----
+
The ID of the sandbox is returned.
--

* Create a container 
+
--
** Pull a busybox image
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo crictl pull busybox
Image is up to date for busybox@sha256:e7157b6d7ebbe2cce5eaa8cfe8aa4fa82d173999b9f90a9ec42e57323546c353
----

** Create configs for the pod and the container:
+
.pod-config.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "nginx-sandbox",
    "namespace": "default",
    "attempt": 1,
    "uid": "hdishd83djaidwnduwk28bcsb"
  },
  "log_directory": "/tmp",
  "linux": {
  }
}
----
+
.container-config.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "busybox"
  },
  "image":{
    "image": "busybox"
  },
  "command": [
    "top"
  ],
  "log_path":"busybox.log",
  "linux": {
  }
}
----

** Create the container, passing the ID of the previously-created pod, the container config file, and the pod config file. The ID of the container is returned.
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo crictl create 7a42c484476cd008df5730df0cbbd679c72ac57b7d16b82d40917ed5ffe20ada container-config.json pod-config.json
1c0bbf7dce7207af100541032c273f0426b1a0d7f44fb00c263b185ee388dc88
----
+
NOTE: You should set the CLI argument `container-config.json` before `pod-config.json`.
--

* Start a container
+
To start a container, pass its ID to crictl start:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo crictl start 1c0bbf7dce7207af100541032c273f0426b1a0d7f44fb00c263b185ee388dc88
1c0bbf7dce7207af100541032c273f0426b1a0d7f44fb00c263b185ee388dc88
----

* Create and start a container within one command
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo crictl run container-config.json pod-config.json
