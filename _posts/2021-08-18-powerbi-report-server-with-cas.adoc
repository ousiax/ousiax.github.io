.Debugging

To debug the extension, you might want to attach the debugger to both `ReportingServicesService.exe`, `RSPortal.exe` and `RSPowerBI.exe`. And add breakpoints to the methods implementing the interface `IAuthenticationExtension2` and `IAuthorizationExtension`.
====

[TIP]
====
.Troubleshooting

If the report server cann't work expectedly, you may need to analyze the reprot server log files at `<install>/LogFiles`, especially the following highlight files :

[source,console,highlight='5,10,11']
----
$ ls -1 LogFiles/

=== Step 2: Deployment and Configuration

[,console]
----
# The Build Outputs of the Security Extenstion Project
$ ls src/PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security/bin/Debug/net48/
EntityFramework.dll*                   Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions.dll*
EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll*         Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.dll*
PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security.dll*  Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.dll*
PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security.pdb   Sso.aspx
----

==== To deploy the security extension

* Copy the `Sso.aspx` page to the `<install>\ReportServer` directory.
* Copy all the `\*.dll` and `*.pdb` to the follow directories:
 ** `<install>\ReportServer\bin`
 ** `<install>\Portal`
 ** `<install>\PowerBI`

==== Modify files in the `<install>\ReportServer` direcotry

* To modify the `rsreportserver.config` file.
* Open the `rsreportserver.config` file with Visual Studio or a simple text editor such as Notepad. `rsreportserver.config` is located in the `<install>\ReportServer` directory.
* Locate the `<AuthenticationTypes>` element and modify the settings as follows:
+
[,xml]
----
<Authentication>
  <AuthenticationTypes>
    <!--<RSWindowsNTLM/>--> <!--1-->
    <Custom/>
  </AuthenticationTypes>
  <RSWindowsExtendedProtectionLevel>Off</RSWindowsExtendedProtectionLevel>
  <RSWindowsExtendedProtectionScenario>Proxy</RSWindowsExtendedProtectionScenario>
  <EnableAuthPersistence>true</EnableAuthPersistence>
</Authentication>
----
+
<1> Note that you cannot use Custom with other authentication types.

* Locate the `<Security>` and `<Authentication>` elements, within the `<Extensions>` element, and modify the settings as follows:
+
[,xml]
----
<Security>
  <Extension Name="Forms" Type="PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security.Authorization, PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security">
    <Configuration>
    <AdminConfiguration>
        <UserName>admin1@local.me,admin2@google.com</UserName> <!--1-->
      </AdminConfiguration>
    </Configuration>
  </Extension>
  <!--<Extension Name="Windows" Type="Microsoft.ReportingServices.Authorization.WindowsAuthorization, Microsoft.ReportingServices.Authorization"/>-->
</Security>
----
+
<1> Note that you should specify one or many administrators here.
+
[,xml]
----
<Authentication>
  <Extension Name="Forms" Type="PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security.Cas.Authentication, PowerBI.ReportingServices.Security"/>
  <!--<Extension Name="Windows" Type="Microsoft.ReportingServices.Authentication.WindowsAuthentication, Microsoft.ReportingServices.Authorization"/>-->
</Authentication>
----

==== To modify the `web.config` file for Report Server

* Open the `web.config` file in a text editor. By default, the file is in the `<install>\ReportServer` directory.
* Locate the `<identity>` element and set the `Impersonate` attribute to `false`.
+
[,xml]
----
<identity impersonate="false" />
<!--<identity impersonate="true" />-->
----

* Locate the `<authentication>` element and change the `Mode` attribute to `Forms`. Also, add the following `<forms>` element as a child of the `<authentication>` element and set the `loginUrl`, `name`, `timeout`, `path`, `requireSSL`, and `cookieSameSite` attributes as follows:
+
[,xml]
----
<!--<authentication mode="Windows" />-->
<authentication mode="Forms">
  <forms loginUrl="Sso.aspx" name="X-RS-TOKEN" timeout="60" path="/" requireSSL="true" cookieSameSite="None">
  </forms>
</authentication>
----
+
For local development, if you cann't debug with HTTPS, you should delete both the `requireSSL` and `cookieSameSite` attributes.
+
[,xml]
----
<!--<authentication mode="Windows" />-->
<authentication mode="Forms">
  <forms loginUrl="Sso.aspx" name="X-RS-TOKEN" timeout="60"  path="/">
  </forms>
</authentication>
----

* Add the following `<authorization>` element directly after the `<authentication>` element.
+
[,xml]
----
<authorization>
  <deny users="?" />
</authorization>
----
+
This will deny unauthenticated users the right to access the report server. The previously established `loginUrl` attribute of the `<authentication>` element will redirect unauthenticated requests to the `Sso.aspx` page.

* Configuration `<appSettings>` and `<connectionStrings>` inner the element `<configuration>` as below.
+
[,xml]
----
<appSettings>
  <add key="cas.baseaddress" value="https://cas.example.com" />
  <add key="cas.login.path" value="/cas/login" />
  <add key="cas.service.validate.path" value="/cas/serviceValidate" />
</appSettings>
----
+
[,xml]
----
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="cas.useraccounts" <!--1-->
       connectionString="Data Source=mssql;Initial Catalog=UserAccounts;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=******"
       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
----
+
<1> Your should modify the `Data Source` with the Server Name of your MSSQL, `User ID` and `Password` with your only SQL Server Authentication credentials.

* Locate the `<trust>` element and update it as follows:
+
[,xml]
----
<!--<securityPolicy>
  <trustLevel name="RosettaSrv" policyFile="rssrvpolicy.config" />
</securityPolicy>
<trust level="RosettaSrv" originUrl="" egacyCasModel="true" />-->
<trust level="Full" />
----

==== To modify the `RSPortal.exe.config` file for Report Server Portal

* Open the `web.config` file in a text editor. By default, the file is in the `<install>\Portal` directory.
* Configuration `<connectionStrings>` under the  `<configuration>` ##as same as## `web.config` as below.

[,xml]
----
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="cas.useraccounts"
       connectionString="Data Source=mssql;Initial Catalog=UserAccounts;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=******"
       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
----

=== Step 3: Generate Machine Keys

Using _Forms_ authentication requires that all report server processes can access the authentication cookie. This involves configuring a machine key and decryption algorithm -- a familiar step for those who had previously setup SSRS to work in scale-out environments.

Generate and add `<MachineKey>` under `<Configuration>` in your `rsreportserver.config` file.

[,xml]
----
<MachineKey ValidationKey="[YOUR KEY]" DecryptionKey="[YOUR KEY]" Validation="AES" Decryption="AES" />
----

The follow code snippet is a sample:

[,xml]
----
<Configuration>
  <MachineKey
    ValidationKey="C9A00A9C93B7AC6B8B3C27054DEDA40FDE08D20C481E808042F32784B3A7F5EF"
    DecryptionKey="8F3D5F7B29A0EB685B61299502490226DA98BCB73B024F78651C24517A5ACCB9"
    Validation="AES"
    Decryption="AES"/>
    . . .
----

*Check the casing of the attributes, it should be Pascal Casing as the example above.*

There is not need for a `<system.web>` entry.

You should use a validation key specific for you deployment, there are several tools to generate the keys such as Internet Information Services Manager (IIS), or the online https://codewithshadman.com/machine-key-generator/[machine-key-generator].

=== Step 4: Configure Passthrough cookies

The new portal and the reportserver communicate using internal soap APIs for some of its operations. When additional cookies are required to be passed from the portal to the server the `PassThroughCookies` properties is still available. More Details: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345241.aspx. In the `rsreportserver.config` file add following under `<UI>`.

[,xml]
----
<UI>
  <ReportServerUrl></ReportServerUrl>
  <PageCountMode>Estimate</PageCountMode>
  <CustomAuthenticationUI>
    <PassThroughCookies>
      <PassThroughCookie>X-RS-TOKEN</PassThroughCookie>
    </PassThroughCookies>
  </CustomAuthenticationUI>
</UI>

== Security Extensions Overview

Reporting Services provides an extensible architecture that allows you to plug in custom or forms-based authentication modules. You might consider implementing a custom authentication extension if deployment requirements do not include Windows integrated security or Basic authentication. The most common scenario for using custom authentication is to support Internet or extranet access to a Web application. Replacing the default Windows Authentication extension with a custom authentication extension gives you more control over how external users are granted access to the report server.

In practice, deploying a custom authentication extension requires multiple steps that include copying assemblies and application files, modifying configuration files, and testing.

NOTE: Creating a custom authentication extension requires custom code and expertise in ASP.NET security. If you do not want to create a custom authentication extension, you can use Microsoft Active Directory groups and accounts, but you should greatly reduce the scope of a report server deployment. For more information about custom authentication, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/extensions/security-extension/implementing-a-security-extension?view=sql-server-ver15[Implementing a Security Extension].

We recommend that you use Windows Authentication if at all possible. However, custom authentication and authorization for Reporting Services may be appropriate in the following two cases:

* You have an Internet or extranet application that cannot use Windows accounts.
* You have custom-defined users and roles and need to provide a matching authorization scheme in Reporting Services.

image::https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/extensions/security-extension/media/rosettasecurityextensionflow.gif?view=sql-server-ver15.gif[Security Extensions Overview]

As shown in the above figure, authentication and authorization occur as follows:

<1> A user tries to access the web portal by using a URL and is redirected to a form that collects user credentials for the client application.
<2> The user submits credentials to the form.
<3> The user credentials are submitted to the Reporting Services Web service through the LogonUser method.
<4> The Web service calls the customer-supplied security extension and verifies that the user name and password exist in the custom security authority.
<5> After authentication, the Web service creates an authentication ticket (known as a "cookie"), manages the ticket, and verifies the user's role for the Home page of the web portal.
<6> The Web service returns the cookie to the browser and displays the appropriate user interface in the web portal.
<7> After the user is authenticated, the browser makes requests to the web portal while transmitting the cookie in the HTTP header. These requests are in response to user actions within the web portal.
<8> The cookie is transmitted in the HTTP header to the Web service along with the requested user operation.
<9> The cookie is validated, and if it is valid, the report server returns the security descriptor and other information relating to the requested operation from the report server database.
<10> If the cookie is valid, the report server makes a call to the security extension to check if the user is authorized to perform the specific operation.
<11> If the user is authorized, the report server performs the requested operation and returns control to the caller.
<12> After the user is authenticated, URL access to the report server uses the same cookie. The cookie is transmitted in the HTTP header.
<13> The user continues to request operations on the report server until the session has ended.

=== Authentication in Reporting Services

Authentication is the process of establishing a user's right to an identity. There are many techniques that you can use to authenticate a user. The most common way is to use passwords. When you implement Forms Authentication, for example, you want an implementation that queries users for credentials (usually by some interface that requests a login name and password) and then validates users against a data store, such as a database table or configuration file. If the credentials can't be validated, the authentication process fails and the user will assume an anonymous identity.

In Reporting Services, the Windows operating system handles the authentication of users either through integrated security or through the explicit reception and validation of user credentials. Custom authentication can be developed in Reporting Services to support additional authentication schemes. This is made possible through the security extension interface https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2[IAuthenticationExtension2]. All extensions inherit from the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iextension[IExtension] base interface for any extension deployed and used by the report server. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iextension[IExtension], as well as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2[IAuthenticationExtension2], are members of the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces[Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces] namespace.

image::https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/extensions/security-extension/media/rosettasecurityextensionauthenticationflow.gif?view=sql-server-ver15[Authentication Flow]

As shown in the above figure, the authentication process is as follows:

<1> A client application calls the Web service https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2.logonuser?view=sqlserver-2016[LogonUser] method to authenticate a user.
<2> The Web service makes a call to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2.logonuser?view=sqlserver-2016[LogonUser] method of your security extension, specifically, the class that implements https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2?view=sqlserver-2016[IAuthenticationExtension2].
<3> Your implementation of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension2.logonuser?view=sqlserver-2016[LogonUser] validates the user name and password in the user store or security authority.
<4> Upon successful authentication, the Web service creates a cookie and manages it for the session.
<5> The Web service returns the authentication ticket to the calling application on the HTTP header.

=== Authorization in Reporting Services

Authorization is the process of determining whether an identity should be granted the requested type of access to a given resource in the report server database. Reporting Services uses a role-based authorization architecture that grants a user access to a given resource based on the user's role assignment for the application. Security extensions for Reporting Services contain an implementation of an authorization component that is used to grant access to users once they are authenticated on the report server. Authorization is invoked when a user attempts to perform an operation on the system or a report server item through the SOAP API and via URL access. This is made possible through the security extension interface https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthorizationextension[IAuthorizationExtension]. As stated previously, all extensions inherit from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iextension[IExtension] the base interface for any extension that you deploy. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iextension[IExtension] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthorizationextension[IAuthorizationExtension] are members of the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces[Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces] namespace.

image::https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/extensions/security-extension/media/rosettasecurityextensionauthorizationflow.gif?view=sql-server-ver15[Authorization Flow]

As shown in the Figure 3, authorization follows this sequence:

<1> Once authenticated, client applications make requests to the report server through the Reporting Services Web service methods. An authentication ticket is passed to the report server in the form of a cookie in the HTTP header of each Web request.
<2> The cookie is validated prior to any access check.
<3> Once the cookie is validated, the report server calls https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthenticationextension.getuserinfo[GetUserInfo] and the user is given an identity.
<4> The user attempts an operation through the Reporting Services Web service.
<5> The report server calls the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthorizationextension.checkaccess[CheckAccess] method.
<6> The security descriptor is retrieved and passed to a custom security extension implementation of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.reportingservices.interfaces.iauthorizationextension.checkaccess[CheckAccess]. At this point, the user, group, or computer is compared to the security descriptor of the item being accessed and is authorized to perform the requested operation.
<7> If the user is authorized, the Web service performs the operation and returns a response to the calling application.
