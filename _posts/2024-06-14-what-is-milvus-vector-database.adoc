Milvus (/ˈmɪlvəs/) is an open-source vector database to store, index, and manage massive https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#Embedding-vectors[embedding vectors] generated by deep neural networks and machine learning (ML) models. <<milvus-overview>>

Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom-up to handle embedding vectors converted from https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#Unstructured-data[unstructured data], including images, video, audio, and natural language.

Embedding vectors or vectors, the output data format of Neural Network models, can effectively encode information and serve a pivotal role in AI applications such as knowledge base, semantic search, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and more. Mathematically speaking, an embedding vector is an array of floating-point numbers or binaries. Modern embedding techniques are used to convert unstructured data to embedding vectors.

Milvus is able to analyze the correlation between two vectors by calculating their similarity distance. If the two embedding vectors are very similar, it means that the original data sources are similar as well. https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#Vector-similarity-search[Vector similarity search] is the process of comparing a vector to a database to find vectors that are most similar to the query vector. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms are used to accelerate the searching process. If the two embedding vectors are very similar, it means that the original data sources are similar as well.

Milvus adopts a shared-storage architecture featuring storage and computing disaggregation and horizontal scalability for its computing nodes. Following the principle of data plane and control plane disaggregation, Milvus comprises four layers: access layer, coordinator service, worker node, and storage. <<milvus-architecture_overview>>

== Milvus Lite

Milvus Lite is the lightweight version of Milvus included in the https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus[Python SDK of Milvus], which can be imported into a Python application, providing the core vector search functionality of Milvus. <<milvus_lite>> <<milvus-quickstart>>

Milvus Lite is good for getting started with vector search or building demos and prototypes, and supports the following OS distributions and sillicon types: Ubuntu >= 20.04 (x86_64), and macOS >= 11.0 (Apple Silicon and x86_64), and Debian 12 (x86_64) on Windows with WSL 2 enabled.

* Install Milvus
+
```sh
# set up Milvus Lite with pymilvus, the Python SDK library of Milvus
pip install "pymilvus>=2.4.2"
```

* Set up vector database
+
```py
# connect to Milvus Lite
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

# generate  or load an existing vector database file named milvus_demo.db in the current folder
client = MilvusClient("milvus_demo.db")
```

* Create a collection
+
```py
# create a collection to store vectors and their associated metadata
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo has 768 dimensions
)
```
+
--
* The primary key and vector fields use their default names ("id" and "vector").

* The metric type (vector distance definition) is set to its default value (https://milvus.io/docs/metric.md#Cosine-Similarity[COSINE]).

* The primary key field accepts integers and does not automatically increments (namely not using https://milvus.io/docs/schema.md[auto-id feature])
--

* Represent text with vectors

** To perform semantic search on text, it's needed to generate vectors for text by downloading embedding models, which can be easily done by using the utility functions from `pymilvus[model]` library including essential ML tools such as PyTorch.
+
```sh
pip install "pymilvus[model]>=2.4.2"
```

** Milvus expects data to be inserted organized as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a data record, termed as an entity.
+
```py
# generate vector embeddings with default model
from pymilvus import model

# If connection to https://huggingface.co/ failed, uncomment the following path
# import os
# os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://hf-mirror.com'

# This will download a small embedding model "paraphrase-albert-small-v2" (~50MB).
embedding_fn = model.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()

# Text strings to search from.
docs = [
    "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.",
    "Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in AI.",
    "Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.",
]

vectors = embedding_fn.encode_documents(docs)
# The output vector has 768 dimensions, matching the collection that we just created.
print("Dim:", embedding_fn.dim, vectors[0].shape)  # Dim: 768 (768,)

# Each entity has id, vector representation, raw text, and a subject label that we use
# to demo metadata filtering later.
data = [
    {"id": i, "vector": vectors[i], "text": docs[i], "subject": "history"}
    for i in range(len(vectors))
]

print("Data has", len(data), "entities, each with fields: ", data[0].keys())
print("Vector dim:", len(data[0]["vector"]))
```
+
```console
Dim: 768 (768,)
Data has 3 entities, each with fields:  dict_keys(['id', 'vector', 'text', 'subject'])
Vector dim: 768
```

** Insert data into the collection.
+
```py
res = client.insert(collection_name="demo_collection", data=data)

print(res)
```
+
```console
{'insert_count': 3, 'ids': [0, 1, 2], 'cost': 0}
```

* Semantic search

** Milvus accepts one or multiple *vector search* requests as a list of vectors, where each vector is an array of float numbers, at the same time. 
+
```py
# from pymilvus import MilvusClient, model
# 
# client = MilvusClient("milvus_demo.db")
# 
# # If connection to https://huggingface.co/ failed, uncomment the following path
# import os
# os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://hf-mirror.com'
# 
# # This will download a small embedding model "paraphrase-albert-small-v2" (~50MB).
# embedding_fn = model.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()

query_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries(["Who is Alan Turing?"])

res = client.search(
    collection_name="demo_collection",  # target collection
    data=query_vectors,  # query vectors
    limit=2,  # number of returned entities
    output_fields=["text", "subject"],  # specifies fields to be returned
)

print(res)
```
+
```console
data: ["[{'id': 2, 'distance': 0.5859944820404053, 'entity': {'text': 'Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.', 'subject': 'history'}}, {'id': 1, 'distance': 0.5118255019187927, 'entity': {'text': 'Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in AI.', 'subject': 'history'}}]"] , extra_info: {'cost': 0}
```
+
```py
# Vector search with metadata filtering

# Insert more docs in another subject.
docs = [
    "Machine learning has been used for drug design.",
    "Computational synthesis with AI algorithms predicts molecular properties.",
    "DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis.",
]
vectors = embedding_fn.encode_documents(docs)
data = [
    {"id": 3 + i, "vector": vectors[i], "text": docs[i], "subject": "biology"}
    for i in range(len(vectors))
]

client.insert(collection_name="demo_collection", data=data)

# This will exclude any text in "history" subject despite close to the query vector.
res = client.search(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    data=embedding_fn.encode_queries(["tell me AI related information"]),
    filter="subject == 'biology'",
    limit=2,
    output_fields=["text", "subject"],
)

print(res)
```
+
```console
data: ["[{'id': 4, 'distance': 0.27030572295188904, 'entity': {'text': 'Computational synthesis with AI algorithms predicts molecular properties.', 'subject': 'biology'}}, {'id': 3, 'distance': 0.1642588973045349, 'entity': {'text': 'Machine learning has been used for drug design.', 'subject': 'biology'}}]"] , extra_info: {'cost': 0}
```

** A query() is an operation that retrieves all entities matching a cretria, such as a filter expression or matching some ids.
+
```py
# retrieving all entities whose scalar field has a particular value
res = client.query(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    filter="subject == 'history'",
    output_fields=["text", "subject"],
)
```
+
```py
# retrieving entities by primary key directly
res = client.query(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    ids=[0, 2],
    output_fields=["vector", "text", "subject"],
)
```

* Delete entities specifying the primary key or delete all entities matching a particular filter expression.
+
```py
# Delete entities by primary key
res = client.delete(collection_name="demo_collection", ids=[0, 2])

print(res)

# Delete entities by a filter expression
res = client.delete(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    filter="subject == 'biology'",
)

print(res)

# Drop collection
client.drop_collection(collection_name="demo_collection")
```
+
```console
[0, 2]
[3, 4, 5]
```
