TCP is a unicast *connection-oriented* protocol.

* Before either end can send data to the other, a connection must be established between them.

* During connection establishment, several options can be exchanged between the two endpoints regarding the parameters of the connection.

* Some options are allowed to be sent only when the connection is established, and others can be sent later.

* Because of its management of *connection state* (information about the connection kept by both endpoints), TCP is a considerably more complicated protocol than UDP.
+
UDP is a *connectionless* protocol that involves no connection establishment or termination.
+
One of the major differences between the two is the amount of detail required to handle the various TCP states properly: when connections are created, terminated normally, and reset without warning.

Recall that TCP's service model is a byte stream. TCP detects and repairs essentially all the data transfer problems that may be introduced by packet loss, duplication, or errors at the IP layer (or below).

== TCP Connection Establishment and Termination

A TCP *_connection_* is defined to be a 4-tuple consisting of two IP addresses and two port numbers. More precisely, it is a pair of _endpoints_ or _sockets_ where each endpoint is identified by an (IP address, port number) pair.

A connection typically goes through three phases: setup, data transfer (called _established_), and teardown (closing).

.A normal TCP connection establishment and termination (without any data transfer). Usually, the client initiates a three-way handshake to exchange initial sequence numbers carried on SYN segments for the client and server (ISN(c) and ISN(s), respectively). The connection terminates after each side has sent a FIN and received an acknowledgment for it.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-connection-management/tcp-connection-establishment-and-termination.png[A normal TCP connection establishment and termination,55%,55%]

To establish a TCP connection, the following events usually take place:

. The *_active opener_* (normally called the client) sends a SYN segment (i.e., a TCP/IP packet with the _SYN_ bit field turned on in the TCP header) specifying the port number of the peer to which it wants to connect and the client's initial sequence number or ISN(c).
+
It typically sends one or more options at this point.
+
This is segment 1.

. The server responds with its own SYN segment containing its initial sequence number (ISN(s)).
+
This is segment 2.
+
The server also acknowledges the client's SYN by ACKing ISN(c) plus 1.
+
A SYN consumes one sequence number and is retransmitted if lost.

. The client must acknowledge this SYN from the server by ACKing ISN(s) plus 1.
+
This is segment 3.

These three segments complete the connection establishment. This is often called the *_three-way handshake_*.

* Its main purposes are to let each end of the connection know that a connection is starting and the special details that are carried as options, and to exchange the ISNs.

* The side that sends the first SYN is said to perform an *active open*. As mentioned, this is typically a client.
* The other side, which receives this SYN and sends the next SYN, performs a *passive open*. It is most commonly called the server.
* There is a supported but unusual *simultaneous open* when both sides can do an active open at the same time and become both clients and servers.

Either end can initiate a close operation, and simultaneous closes are also supported but are rare.

* Traditionally, it was most common for the client to initiate a close.
* However, other servers (e.g., Web servers) initiate a close after they have completed a request.
* Usually a close operation starts with an application indicating its desire to terminate its connection (e.g., using the `close()` system call).
* The closing TCP initiates the close operation by sending a FIN segment (i.e., a TCP segment with the _FIN_ bit field set).

The complete close operation occurs after both sides have completed the close:

. The *active closer* sends a FIN segment specifying the current sequence number the receiver expects to see (_K_).
+
The FIN also includes an ACK for the last data sent in the other direction (labeled _L_).

. The *passive closer* responds by ACKing value _K + 1_ to indicate its successful receipt of the active closer's FIN.
+
At this point, the application is notified that the other end of its connection has performed a close.
+
Typically this results in the application initiating its own close operation.
+
The passive closer then effectively becomes another active closer and sends its own FIN. The sequence number is equal to _L_.

. To complete the close, the final segment contains an ACK for the last FIN.
+
Note that if a FIN is lost, it is retransmitted until an ACK for it is received.

While it takes three segments to establish a connection, it takes four to terminate one.

It is also possible for the connection to be in a _half-open_ state, although this is not common. This reason is that TCP's data communications model is bidirectional, meaning it is possible to have only one of the two directions operating.

The _half-close_ operation in TCP closes only a single direction of the data flow. Two half-close operations together close the entire connection. The rule is that either end can send a FIN when it is done sending data.

When a TCP receives a FIN, it must notify the application that the other end has terminated that direction of data flow. The sending of a FIN is normally the result of the application issuing a close operation, which typically causes both directions to close.

The seven segments we have seen are baseline overheads for any TCP connection that is established and cleared gracefully.

* When a small amount of data needs to be exchanged, it is now apparent why some applications prefer to use UDP because of its ability to send and receive data without establishing connections.

* However, such applications are then faced with handling their own error repair features, congestion management, and flow control.

=== TCP Half-Close

TCP supports a half-close operation. Few applications require this capability, so it is not common.

To use this feature, the API must provide a way for the application to say, essentially, "I am done sending data, so send a FIN to the other end, but I still want to receive data from the other end, until it sends me a FIN".

The Berkeley sockets API supports half-close, if the application calls the `shutdown()` function instead of calling the more typical `close()` function. Most applications, however, terminate both directions of the connection by calling `close`.

.With the TCP half-close operation, one direction of the connection can terminate while the other continues until it is closed. Few applications use this feature.

=== Simultaneous Open and Close

It is possible, although highly improbable unless specifically arranged, for two applications to perform an active open to each other at the same time. If this happens, it is called a *simultaneous open*.

* Each end must have transmitted a SYN before receiving a SYN from the other side; the SYNs must pass each other on the network.
* This scenario also requires each end to have an IP address and port number that are known to the other end, which is rare (except for the firewall _hole-punching_ techniques).
* A simultaneous open requires the exchange of four segments, one more than the normal three-way handshake.
* Also note that we do not call either end a client or a server, because both ends act as client and server.

.Segments exchanged during simultaneous open. One additional segment is required compared to the ordinary connection establishment procedure. The SYN bit field is on in each segment until an ACK for it is received.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-connection-management/tcp-simultaneous-open.png[TCP simultaneous open,55%,55%]

With a *simultaneous close* the same number of segments are exchanged as in the normal close. The only real difference is that the segment sequence is interleaved instead of sequential.

.Segments exchanged during simultaneous close work like a conventional close, but the segment ordering is interleaved.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-connection-management/tcp-simultaneous-close.png[TCP simultaneous close,55%,55%]

=== Initial Sequence Number (ISN)

When a connection is open, any segment with the appropriate two IP addresses and port numbers is accepted as valid provided the sequence number is valid (i.e., within the window) and the checksum is OK.

Before each end sends its SYN to establish the connection, it chooses an ISN for that connection.

* The ISN should change over time, so that each connection has a different one.
+
[RFC0793] specifies that the ISN should be viewed as a 32-bit counter that increments by 1 every 4Î¼s.

* The purpose of doing this is to arrange for the sequence numbers for segments on one connection to not overlap with sequence numbers on a another (new) identical connection.

* In particular, new sequence numbers must not be allowed to overlap between different _instantiations_ (or _incarnations_) of the _same_ connection.

* In modern systems, the ISN is typically selected in a semirandom way.

If a connection had one of its segments delayed for a long period of time and closed, but then opened again with the same 4-tuple, it is conceivable that the delayed segment could reenter the new connection's data stream as valid data.

* By taking steps to avoid overlap in sequence numbers between connection instantiations, we can try to minimize this risk.

* It does suggest, however, that an application with a very great need for data integrity should employ its own CRCs or checksums at the application layer to ensure that its own data has been transferred without error.
+
This is generally good practice in any case, and it is commonly done for large files.

The connection 4-tuple as well as the currently active window of sequence numbers is all that is required to form a TCP segment that is considered valid to a communicating TCP endpoint, which represents a form of vulnerability for TCP:

* anyone can forge a TCP segment and, if the sequence numbers, IP addresses, and port numbers are chosen appropriately, can interrupt a TCP connection [RFC5961].
* One way of repelling this is to make the initial sequence number (or ephemeral port number [RFC6056]) relatively hard to guess. Another is encryption.

=== Timeout of Connection Establishment

There are several circumstances in which a connection cannot be established. One obvious case is when the server host is down.

To simulate this scenario, we issue our telnet command to a nonexistent host in the same subnet.

* If we do this without modifying the ARP table, the client exits with a "No route to host" error message, generated because no ARP reply is ever returned for the ARP request.
* If, however, we place an ARP entry for a nonexistent host in the ARP table first, the ARP request is not sent, and the system immediately attempts to contact the nonexistent host with TCP/IP. First, the commands:
+
[source,console]
----
x@node-0:~$ sudo ip neigh add 192.168.91.120 lladdr 00:00:1a:1b:1c:1d dev ens32
----
+
Here the MAC address `00:00:1a:1b:1c:1d` was chosen simply as a MAC address not being used on the LAN; it is of no special consequence.

* The timeout occurs about 2 minutes after the initial command.

The number of times to retry an initial SYN can be configured on some systems. In Linux,

* the system configuration variable `net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries` gives the maximum number of times to attempt to resend a SYN segment during an active open.

* A corresponding value called `net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries` gives the maximum number of times to attempt to resend a SYN + ACK segment when responding to a peer's active open request.

* It can also be used on an individual connection basis by setting the Linux-specific TCP_SYNCNT socket option.

* Every option begins with a 1-byte _kind_ that specifies the type of option.

* Options that are not understood are simply ignored, according to [RFC1122].

* The options with a _kind_ value of 0 and 1 occupy a single byte.

* The other options have a _len_ byte that follows the _kind_ byte. The length is the total length, including the _kind_ and _len_ bytes.

* The reason for the NOP option is to allow the sender to pad fields to a multiple of 4 bytes, if it needs to.
+
Remember that the TCP header's length is always required to be a multiple of 32 bits because the TCP _Header Length_ field uses that unit.

* The EOL option indicates the end of the list and that no further processing of the options list is to be performed.

=== Maximum Segment Size (MSS) Option

The maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest segment that a TCP is willing to receive from its peer and, consequently, the largest size its peer should ever use when sending.

* The MSS value counts only TCP data bytes and does not include the sizes of any associated TCP or IP header [RFC0879].

* When a connection is established, each end usually announces its MSS in an MSS option carried with its SYN segment.

* The option allows for 16 bits to be used to specify the MSS value.

* If no MSS option is provided, a default value of 536 bytes is used.
+
Recall the rule that requires any host to be capable of processing IPv4 datagrams at least as large as 576.
+
With minimum-size IPv4 and TCP headers, a TCP using a sending MSS size of 536 bytes produces an IPv4 datagram of size 20 + 20 + 536 = 576 bytes.

* The MSS value 1460 is typical for IPv4.
+
The resulting IPv4 datagram is normally 40 bytes larger (1500 bytes total, the typical MTU size for Ethernet and path MTU for the Internet): 20 bytes for the TCP header and 20 bytes for the IPv4 header.

* When IPv6 is used, the MSS is usually 1440, 20 bytes less because of the larger IPv6 header.
+
The special MSS value of 65535 can be used with IPv6 jumbograms to indicate an effective MSS of infinity [RFC2675].
+
In this case the SMSS will be determined as the PMTU minus 60 bytes (40 bytes for the IPv6 header and 20 bytes for the TCP header).

* Note that the MSS option is not a negotiation between one TCP and its peer; it is a limit.
+
When one TCP gives its MSS option to the other, it is indicating its unwillingness to accept any segments larger than that size for the duration of the connection.

=== Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) Options

Because it uses cumulative ACKs, TCP with a sliding window is never able to acknowledge data it has received correctly but that is not contiguous, in terms of sequence numbers, with data it has received previously.

* In such cases, the TCP receiver is said to have _holes_ in its received data queue.
* A receiving TCP prevents applications from consuming data beyond a hole because of the byte stream abstraction it provides.

If a TCP sender were able to learn of the existence of holes (and out-of-sequence data blocks beyond holes in the sequence space) at the receiver, it could better select which particular TCP segments to retransmit when segments are lost or otherwise missing at the receiver.

* The TCP selective acknowledgment (SACK) options [RFC2018][RFC2883] provide this capability.
* The scheme works effectively, however, only if the TCP sender logic is able to make effective use of the SACK information it receives from a SACK-capable receiver.
* A TCP learns that its peer is capable of advertising SACK information by receiving the _SACK-Permitted_ option in a SYN (or SYN + ACK) segment.
* Once this has taken place, the TCP receiving out-of-sequence data may provide a _SACK_ option that describes the out-of-sequence data to help its peer perform retransmissions more efficiently.

SACK information contained in a SACK option consists of a range of sequence numbers representing data blocks the receiver has successfully received.

* Each range is called a SACK _block_ and is represented by a pair of 32-bit sequence numbers.

* Thus, a _SACK_ option containing _n_ SACK blocks is (_8n + 2_) bytes long. Two bytes are used to hold the kind and length of the _SACK_ option.

* Because of the limited amount of space available in the option space of a TCP header, the maximum number of SACK blocks available to be sent in a single segment is three (assuming the _Timestamps_ option is also used, which is typical for modern TCP implementations).

* Although the _SACK-Permitted_ option is only ever sent in a SYN segment, the SACK blocks themselves may be sent in any segment once the sender has sent the _SACK-Permitted_ option.

* The operation of SACK is most easily (and importantly) related to the error and congestion control operations of TCP.

=== Window Scale (WSCALE or WSOPT) Option

The _Window Scale_ option (denoted _WSCALE_ or _WSOPT_) [RFC1323] effectively increases the capacity of the TCP _Window Advertisement_ field from 16 to about 30 bits.

Instead of changing the field size, however, the header still holds a 16-bit value, and an option is defined that applies a scaling factor to the 16-bit value.

* This factor effectively left-shifts the window field value by the scale factor.
+
This, in effect, multiplies the window value by the value 2^s^, where _s_ is the scale factor.

* The 1-byte shift count is between 0 and 14 (inclusive).

** A shift count of 0 indicates no scaling.
** The maximum scale value of 14 provides for a maximum window of 1,073,725,440 bytes (65,535 Ã 2^14^), close to 1,073,741,823 (2^30^ â1), effectively 1GB.
+
TCP then maintains the _real_ window size internally as a 32-bit value.

This option can appear only in a SYN segment, so the scale factor is fixed in each direction when the connection is established.

* To enable window scaling, both ends must send the option in their SYN segments.
* The end doing the active open sends the option in its SYN, but the end doing the passive open can send the option only if the received SYN specifies the option.
* The scale factor can be different in each direction.
+
If the end doing the active open sends a nonzero scale factor but does not receive a _Window Scale_ option from the other end, it sets its send and receive scale values to 0.
+
This lets systems that do not understand the option interoperate with systems that do.

Assume we are using the _Window Scale_ option, with a shift count of _S_ for sending and a shift count of _R_ for receiving.

* Then every 16-bit advertised window that we receive from the other end is left-shifted by _R_ bits to obtain the real advertised window size.
* Every time we send a window advertisement to the other end, we take our real 32-bit window size and right-shift it _S_ bits, placing the resulting 16-bit value in the TCP header.

The shift count is automatically chosen by TCP, based on the size of the receive buffer. The size of this buffer is set by the system, but the capability is normally provided for the application to change it.

The _Window Scale_ option is most relevant when TCP is used to provide bulk data transfer over networks with large-bandwidth-delay products (i.e., those with a product of round-trip time and bandwidth being relatively large).

=== Timestamps Option and Protection against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS)

The _Timestamps_ option (sometimes called the _Timestamp_ option and written as _TSOPT_ or _TSopt_) lets the sender place two 4-byte timestamp values in every segment.

The receiver reflects these values in the acknowledgment, allowing the sender to calculate an estimate of the connection's RTT for each ACK received.

* We must say "each ACK received" and not "each segment" because TCP often acknowledges multiple segments per ACK.

* When using the _Timestamps_ option,

** the sender places a 32-bit value in the _Timestamp Value_ field (called _TSV_ or _TSval_) in the first part of the _TSOPT_,
** and the receiver echoes this back unchanged in the second _Timestamp Echo Retry_ field (called _TSER_ or _TSecr_).

* TCP headers containing this option increase by 10 bytes (8 bytes for the two timestamp values and 2 to indicate the option value and length).

* The timestamp is a monotonically increasing value.

** Because the receiver simply echoes what it receives, it does not care what the timestamp units or values actually are.
** This option does not require any form of clock synchronization between the two hosts.
** [RFC1323] recommends that the sender increment the timestamp value by at least 1 every second.

The main reason for wishing to calculate a good estimate of the connection's RTT is to set the retransmission timeout, which tells TCP when it should try resending a segment that is likely lost.

* With the _Timestamps_ option, we can get relatively fine-grain measurements of the RTT.
* Prior to the creation of the _Timestamps_ option, most TCPs would perform just one RTT sample per window of data.
* With the _Timestamps_ option, more samples can be taken, leading to the potential of a better RTT estimate (see [RFC1323] and [RFC6298]).

The _Timestamps_ option allows for more frequent RTT samples, but it also provides a way for the receiver to avoid receiving old segments and considering them as valid, which is called _Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers_ (PAWS), and it is described in [RFC1323] along with the _Timestamps_ option.

=== User Timeout (UTO) Option

The _User Timeout_ (UTO) option is a relatively new TCP capability described in [RFC5482]. The UTO value (also called _USER_TIMEOUT_) specifies the amount of time a TCP sender is willing to wait for an ACK of outstanding data before concluding that the remote end has failed.

_USER_TIMEOUT_ has traditionally been a local configuration parameter for TCP [RFC0793]. The UTO option allows one TCP to signal its _USER_TIMEOUT_ value to its connection peer. This allows the receiving TCP to adjust its behavior (e.g., to tolerate a longer period of disrupted connectivity prior to aborting a connection). NAT devices could also interpret such information to help set their connection activity timers.

UTO option values are advisory; just because one end of a connection might wish to use a large or small UTO value does not mean that the other end needs to comply.

UTO options are included on SYN segments when a connection is established, on the first non-SYN segments, and whenever the _USER_TIMEOUT_ value is changed. The option value is expressed as a 15-bit value in units of seconds or minutes following a bit field (_granularity_) that indicates that the value is in minutes (_1_) or seconds (_0_). As a relatively new option, it is not yet widely deployed.

=== Authentication Option (TCP-AO)

There is an option used to enhance the security of TCP connections. It is designed to enhance and replace an earlier mechanism called _TCP-MD5_ [RFC2385]. Called the _TCP Authentication Option_ (TCP-AO) [RFC5925], it uses a cryptographic hash algorithm, in combination with a secret value known to each end of a TCP connection, to authenticate each segment.

TCP-AO improves upon TCP-MD5 by supporting a variety of cryptographic algorithms and identifying changing of keys using in-band signaling. It does not provide a comprehensive key management solution, however. That is, each end still has to have a way to establish a shared set of keys prior to operation.

However, because it requires creation and distribution of a shared key (and is a relatively new option), it is not yet widely deployed.

== Path MTU Discovery with TCP

The path MTU is the minimum MTU on any network segment that is currently in the path between two hosts.

* Knowing the path MTU can help protocols such as TCP avoid fragmentation.

* The discovering of the path MTU (PMTUD) is accomplished based on ICMP messages.
+
We shall use the ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) terminology to refer to either ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable (Fragmentation Required) or ICMPv6 Packet Too Big messages.
+
A method that avoids the use of ICMP, called _Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery_ (PLPMTUD), can also be used by TCP [RFC4821] or by other transport protocols.

* UDP is not usually able to adapt its datagram size because the application specifies the size (i.e., not the transport protocol).
+
TCP, in providing the byte stream abstraction it implements, determines what segment size to use and as a result has a much greater degree of control over the size of IP datagrams that are ultimately generated.

TCP's regular PMTUD process operates as follows:

* When a connection is established, TCP uses the minimum of the MTU of the outgoing interface, or the MSS announced by the other end, as the basis for selecting its _send maximum segment size_ (SMSS).

* PMTUD does not allow TCP to exceed the MSS announced by the other end.

* If the other end does not specify an MSS, the sender assumes a default of 536 bytes, but this situation is now rare.

* It is also possible for an implementation to save path MTU information on a per-destination basis to help in selecting its segment size.

* Note that the path MTU in each direction of a connection could be different.

* Once the initial SMSS is chosen, all IPv4 datagrams sent by TCP on that connection have the IPv4 _DF_ bit field set.
+
For TCP/IPv6, this is not necessary because there is no DF bit field; all datagrams are assumed to have it set implicitly.

* If a PTB is received, TCP decreases the segment size and retransmits using a different segment size.
+
If the PTB contains the suggested next-hop MTU, the segment size can be set to the next-hop MTU minus the sizes of the IPv4 (or IPv6) and TCP headers.
+
If the next-hop MTU value is not present (e.g., an older ICMP error was returned that lacks this information), the sender may try a variety of values (e.g., binary-search for a usable value).
+
This also affects TCP's congestion control management.

* For PLPMTUD the situation is similar, except PTB messages are not used.
+
Instead, the protocol performing PMTUD must be able to detect message discards quickly and perform its own datagram size adjustments.

* Because routes can change dynamically, when some time has passed since the last decrease of the segment size, a larger value (up to the initial SMSS) can be tried.
+
Guidance in [RFC1191] and [RFC1981] recommends that this time interval be about 10 minutes.

There are a number of problems with PMTUD when it operates in an Internet environment with firewalls that block PTB messages [RFC2923].

Of the various operational problems with PMTUD, *_black holes_* have been the most problematic, although the situation is improving (in [LS10], 80% of systems studied were able to properly process PTB messages).

PMTUD _black holes_ arise when a TCP implementation that depends on the delivery of ICMP messages to adjust its segment size never receives them.

* This could be for several reasons, including a firewall or NAT configuration that prohibits such ICMP messages from being forwarded.

* The consequence is a TCP connection that cannot proceed once it starts to use larger packets.

* It can be difficult to diagnose because only large packets cannot be forwarded.
+
The smaller ones (such as SYN and SYN + ACK packets used to establish the connection) generally succeed.

Some TCP implementations have _black hole detection_, which amounts to trying a smaller segment size when a segment is retransmitted several times.

== TCP State Transitions

The rules which types of segments are sent during different phases of a TCP connection that determine what TCP does are determined by what state TCP is in.

The current state is changed based on various stimuli, such as segments that are transmitted or received, timers that expire, application reads or writes, or information from other layers.

These rules can be summarized in TCP's state transition diagram.

.The TCP state transition diagram (also called finite state machine). Arrows represent transitions between states due to segment transmission, segment reception, or timers expiring. The bold arrows indicate typical client behavior, and the dashed arrows indicate typical server behavior. The boldface directives (e.g., open, close) are actions performed by applications.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-connection-management/tcp-state-transistion-digram.png[TCP state transition diagram,55%,55%]

* States are indicated by ovals and transitions between states by arrows. Each endpoint of a connection transitions through the states.

* The state CLOSED is not really an _official_ state but has been added as a useful starting point and ending point for the diagram.

* The names of the 11 states (CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, etc.) are based on the names output by the `netstat` command in UNIX, Linux, and Windows, which are themselves based on the names originally used in [RFC0793].

=== TIME_WAIT (2MSL Wait) State

The *TIME_WAIT* state is also called the *2MSL* wait state, which is a state in which TCP waits for a time equal to twice the _Maximum Segment Lifetime_ (MSL), sometimes called _timed wait_. It is the maximum amount of time any segment can exist in the network before being discarded.

.TCP states corresponding to normal connection establishment and termination
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-connection-management/tcp-state-normal-estab-term.png[TCP states corresponding to normal connection establishment and termination,55%,55%]

[RFC0793] specifies the MSL as 2 minutes. Common implementation values, however, are 30s, 1 minute, or 2 minutes.

* On Linux, the value `net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout` holds the 2MSL wait timeout value (in seconds).

* On Windows, the following registry key: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpTimedWaitDelay` holds the timeout. It is permitted to be in the range of 30 to 300s. For IPv6, replace the term _Tcpip_ with _Tcpip6_.

Given the MSL value for an implementation, the rule is: _When TCP performs an active close and sends the final ACK, that connection must stay in the TIME_WAIT state for twice the MSL._ This lets TCP resend the final ACK in case it is lost.

* The final ACK is resent not because the TCP retransmits ACKs (they do not consume sequence numbers and are not retransmitted by TCP), but because the other side will retransmit its FIN (which does consume a sequence number).

* Indeed, TCP will always retransmit FINs until it receives a final ACK.

Another effect of this 2MSL wait state is that _while the TCP implementation waits, the endpoints defining that connection cannot be reused_. That connection defined by the address/port 4-tuple can be reused

* only when the 2MSL wait is over, or
* when a new connection uses an ISN that exceeds the highest sequence number used on the previous instantiation of the connection [RFC1122], or
* if the use of the _Timestamps_ option allows the disambiguation of segments from a previous connection instantiation to not otherwise be confused [RFC6191].

Unfortunately, some implementations impose a more stringent constraint. In these systems, a local port number cannot be reused while that port number is the local port number of any endpoint that is in the 2MSL wait state on the system.

Most implementations and APIs provide a way to bypass this restriction.

With the Berkeley sockets API, the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option enables the bypass operation.

* It lets the caller assign itself a local port number even if that port number is part of some connection in the 2MSL wait state.

* We will see, however, that even with this bypass mechanism for one socket (address, port number pair), the rules of TCP still (should) prevent this port number from being reused by another instantiation of the same connection that is in the 2MSL wait state.

* Any delayed segments that arrive for a connection while it is in the 2MSL wait state are discarded.
+
Because the connection defined by the address/port 4-tuple in the 2MSL wait state cannot be reused during this time period, when a valid connection is finally established, we know that delayed segments from an earlier instantiation of this connection cannot be misinterpreted as being part of the new connection.

For interactive applications, it is normally the client that does the active close and enters the TIME_WAIT state. The server usually does the passive close and does not go through the TIME_WAIT state.

* The implication is that if we terminate a client, and restart the same client immediately, that new client cannot reuse the same local port number.
+
This is not ordinarily a problem, because clients normally use ephemeral ports assigned by the operating system and do not care what the assigned port number is.
+
Recall, it is actually a recommended practice for them to be randomized for security reasons [RFC6056].
+
This is important to know because a client that makes a large number of connections quickly (especially to the same server) could conceivably have to delay while other connections terminate if ephemeral ports are in short supply.

* If we terminate a server process that has a connection established and immediately try to restart it, the server cannot assign its well-knonw assigned port number to its endpoint (it gets an _Address already in use_ binding error), because that port number is part of a connection that is in a 2MSL wait state.
+
It may take from 1 to 4 minutes for the server to be able to restart, depending on the local system's value for the MSL.

=== Quiet Time Concept

The 2MSL wait provides protection against delayed segments from an earlier instantiation of a connection being interpreted as part of a new connection that uses the same local and foreign IP addresses and port numbers. But this works only if a host with connections in the 2MSL wait does not crash.

What if a host with connections in the TIME_WAIT state crashes, reboots within the MSL, and immediately establishes new connections using the same local and foreign IP addresses and port numbers corresponding to the local connections that were in the TIME_WAIT state before the crash? In this scenario, delayed segments from the connections that existed before the crash can be misinterpreted as belonging to the new connections created after the reboot. This can happen regardless of how the initial sequence number is chosen after the reboot.

To protect against this scenario, [RFC0793] states that TCP should wait an amount of time equal to the MSL before creating any new connections after a reboot or crash. This is called the *quiet time*. Few implementations abide by this because most hosts take longer than the MSL to reboot after a crash. Also, if applications use their own checksums or encryption, errors such as these are easily detected.

=== FIN_WAIT_2 State

In the FIN_WAIT_2 state, TCP has sent a FIN and the other end has acknowledged it.

* Unless a half-close is being performed, the TCP must wait for the application on the other end to recognize that it has received an end-of-file notification and close its end of the connection, which causes a FIN to be sent.

* Only when the application performs this close (and its FIN is received) does the active closing TCP move from the FIN_WAIT_2 to the TIME_WAIT state.

* This means that one end of the connection can remain in this state forever.

* The other end is still in the CLOSE_WAIT state and can remain there forever, until the application decides to issue its close.

Many implementations prevent this infinite wait in the FIN_WAIT_2 state as follows:

* If the application that does the active close does a complete close, not a half-close indicating that it expects to receive data, a timer is set.
* If the connection is idle when the timer expires, TCP moves the connection into the CLOSED state.

In Linux, the variable `net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout` can be adjusted to control the number of seconds to which the timer is set. Its default value is 60s.

=== Simultaneous Open and Close Transitions

We have seen the normal uses for the SYN_SENT and SYN_RCVD states that correspond to sending and receiving SYN segments, respectively. As illustrated
in Figure 13-3, TCP was purposely designed to handle simultaneous opens that
result in a single connection. 

When a simultaneous open occurs, both ends send a SYN at about the same time, entering the SYN_SENT state.

* When each end receives its peer's SYN segments, the state changes to SYN_RCVD, and each end resends a SYN and acknowledges the received SYN.
* When each end receives the SYN plus the ACK, the state changes to ESTABLISHED.

For a simultaneous close, both ends go from ESTABLISHED to FIN_WAIT_1 when the application issues the close. This causes both FINs to be sent, and they probably pass each other somewhere in the network.

* When its peer's FIN arrives, each end transitions from FIN_WAIT_1 to the CLOSING state, and each endpoint sends its final ACK.
* Upon receiving a final ACK, each endpoint's state changes to TIME_WAIT, and the 2MSL wait is initiated.

== Reset Segments

A segment having _RST_ bit set to `on` is called a _reset segment_ or simply a _reset_. In general, a reset is sent by TCP whenever a segment arrives that does not appear to be correct for the _referenced connection_ specified by the 4-tuple of the reset.

Resets ordinarily result in a fast teardown of a TCP connection.

=== Connection Request to Nonexistent Port

A common case for generating a reset segment is when a connection request arrives and no process is listening on the destination port.

----

Because the _ACK_ bit field was not on in the arriving SYN segment, the sequence number of the reset is set to 0 and the ACK number is set to the incoming ISN plus the number of data bytes in the segment.

=== Aborting a Connection

The normal way to terminate a connection is for one side to send a FIN, which is sometimes called an _orderly release_ because the FIN is sent after all previously queued data has been sent, and there is normally no loss of data. But it is also possible to abort a connection by sending a reset instead of a FIN at any time which is sometimes called an _abortive release_.

Aborting a connection provides two features to the application: (1) any queued data is thrown away and a reset segment is sent immediately, and (2) the receiver of the reset can tell that the other end did an abort instead of a normal close. The API being used by the application must provide a way to generate the abort instead of a normal close.

The sockets API provides this capability by using the _linger on close_ socket option (`SO_LINGER`) with a `0` linger value, which essentially this means _Linger for no time in making sure data gets to the other side, then abort_.

In the following example, we show what happens when a remote command that generates a large amount of output is canceled by the user:

:internet_censorship_in_iran: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran#Deep_packet_inspection

TCP reset attack, also known as a "forged TCP reset" or "spoofed TCP reset", is a way to terminate a TCP connection by sending a forged TCP reset packet. This tampering technique can be used by a firewall or abused by a malicious attacker to interrupt Internet connections. <<tcp_reset_attack>>

{the_great_firewall_of_china}[The Great Firewall of China], and {internet_censorship_in_iran}[Iranian Internet censors] are known to use TCP reset attacks to interfere with and block connections, as a major method to carry out Internet censorship.

=== Half-Open Connections

A TCP connection is said to be *half-open* if one end has closed or aborted the connection without the knowledge of the other end.

* This can happen anytime one of the peers crashes.

* As long as there is no attempt to transfer data across a half-open connection, the end that is still up does not detect that the other end has crashed.

Another common cause of a half-open connection is when one host is powered off instead of shut down properly. This happens, for example,

* when PCs are being used to run remote login clients and are switched off at the end of the day.

* If there was no data transfer going on when the power was cut, the server will never know that the client disappeared (it would still think the connection is in the ESTABLISHED state).

* When the user comes in the next morning, powers on the PC, and starts a new session, a new occurrence of the server is started on the server host.

* This can lead to many half-open TCP connections on the server host.

We can easily create a half-open connection. In this case, we do so on the client rather than the server.

* We will execute the Telnet client on `node-0`, connecting to the SSH Service server at `node-1`.
* We type one line of input and watch it go across with `tcpdump`, and then we disconnect the Ethernet cable on the server's host and reboot the server host. This simulates the server host crashing.
+
We disconnect the Ethernet cable before rebooting the server to prevent it from sending a FIN out of the open connections, which some TCPs do when they are shut down.
* After the server has rebooted, we reconnect the cable and try to send another line from the client to the server.

* After rebooting, the server's TCP has lost all memory of the connections that existed before, so it knows nothing about the connection that the data segment references. The rule of TCP is that the receiver responds with a reset.

=== TIME-WAIT Assassination (TWA)

During TIME-WAIT state period, the waiting TCP usually has little to do; it merely holds the state until the 2MSL timer expires.

If, however, it receives certain segments from the connection during this period, or more specifically an RST segment, it can become desynchronized. This is called *TIME-WAIT Assassination* (TWA) [RFC1337].

.An RST segment can "assassinate" the TIME_WAIT state and force the connection to close prematurely. Various methods exist to resist this problem, including ignoring RST segments when in the TIME_WAIT state.

== TCP Server Operation

When a new connection request arrives at a server, the server accepts the connection and invokes a new process or thread to handle the new client concurrently.

=== TCP Port Numbers

We shall watch the secure shell server (called `sshd`) using the `netstat` command on a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6-capable host. The following output is on a system with no active secure shell connections.

[source,console]
----
x@node-0:~$ netstat -nat
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN     
----

* The local address (which really means _local endpoint_) is output as `0.0.0.0:22` and `:::22`, which are the IPv4/IPv6-oriented ways of referring to the all-zeros address, also called the _wildcard_ address, along with port number 22. This means that an incoming connection request (i.e., a SYN) to port 22 will be accepted on any local interface.
+
If the host were multihomed (this one is), we could specify a single IP address for the local IP address (one of the host's IP addresses), and only connections received on that interface would be accepted.
+
Port 22 is the well-known port number reserved for the Secure Shell Protocol.

* The foreign address is output as `0.0.0.0:*` and `:::*`, which mean both a wildcard address and port number (i.e., it represents a wildcard endpoint).
+
Here, the foreign IP address and foreign port number are not known yet, because the local endpoint is in the LISTEN state, waiting for a connection to arrive.

We now start a secure shell client on the host through a NAT `192.168.91.1` that connects to this server.

[source,console]
----
x@node-0:~$ netstat -n -t -a

----

* The second line for port 22 is the ESTABLISHED connection.
+
All four elements of the local and foreign endpoints are filled in for this connection: the local IP address and port number, and the foreign IP address and port number.
+
The local IP address corresponds to the interface on which the connection request arrived (the Ethernet interface, identified by address, `192.168.91.128`).

* The local endpoint in the LISTEN state is left alone.
+
This is the endpoint that the concurrent server uses to accept future connection requests. It is the TCP module in the operating system that creates the new endpoint in the ESTABLISHED state, when the incoming connection request arrives and is accepted.

* Also notice that the port number for the ESTABLISHED connection does not change: it is 22, the same as the LISTEN endpoint.

We now initiate another client request from the same system (`192.168.91.1`) to this server. Here is the relevant `netstat` output:

=== Restricting Local IP Addresses

We can see what happens when the server does not wildcard the local IP address but instead sets it to one particular local address. If we run our `nc` program as a server and provide it with a particuclar IP address, that address becomes the local address of the listening endpoint. For example:

[source,console]

If we instead try to connect to this server from a host using a destination address other than `192.168.91.128` (even including the local address `127.0.0.1`), the connection request is not accepted by the TCP module, meanwhile the server application never sees the connection request.

=== Restricting Foreign Endpoints

The abstract interface functions for TCP given in [RFC0793] allow a server doing a passive open to have either a fully specified foreign endpoint (to wait for a particular client to issue an active open) or an unspecified foreign endpoint (to wait for any client).

Unfortunately, the ordinary Berkeley sockets API does not provide a way to do this. The server must leave the client's endpoint unspecified, wait for the connection to arrive, and then examine the IP address and port number of the client.

=== Incoming Connection Queue

A concurrent server invokes a new process or thread to handle each client, so the listening server should always be ready to handle the next incoming connection request. That is the underlying reason for using concurrent servers.

But there is still a chance that multiple connection requests will arrive

* while the listening server is creating a new process,
* or while the operating system is busy running other higher-priority processes,
* or worse yet, that the server is being attacked with bogus connection requests that are never allowed to be established.

How does TCP handle these scenarios?

To fully explore this question, we must first understand that new connections may be in one of two distinct states before they are made available to an application.

* The first case is connections that have not yet completed but for which a SYN has been received (these are in the *SYN_RCVD* state).

* The second case is connections that have already completed the three-way handshake and are in the *ESTABLISHED* state but have not yet been accepted by the application.

An application has limited control over the sizing of these queues.

* Traditionally, using the Berkeley sockets API, an application had only indirect control of the sum of the sizes of these two queues.
* In modern Linux kernels this behavior has been changed to be the number of connections in the second case (ESTABLISHED connections).
+
The application can therefore limit the number of fully formed connections waiting for it to handle.

In Linux, then, the following rules apply:

. When a connection request arrives (i.e., the SYN segment), the system-wide parameter `net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog` is checked (default 1000).
+
If the number of connections in the SYN_RCVD state would exceed this threshold, the incoming connection is rejected.

. Each listening endpoint has a fixed-length queue of connections that have been completely accepted by TCP (i.e., the three-way handshake is complete) but not yet accepted by the application.
+
--
** The application specifies a limit to this queue, commonly called the *backlog*.

** This backlog must be between `0` and a system-specific maximum called `net.core.somaxconn`, inclusive (default 128).

** Keep in mind that this backlog value specifies only the maximum number of queued connections for *_one_* listening endpoint, all of which have already been accepted by TCP and are _waiting to be accepted by the application_.

** This backlog has no effect whatsoever on the maximum number of established connections allowed by the system, or on the number of clients that a concurrent server can handle concurrently.
--

. If there is room on this listening endpointâs queue for this new connection, the TCP module ACKs the SYN and completes the connection.
+
--
** The server application with the listening endpoint does not see this new connection until the third segment of the three-way handshake is received.

** Also, the client may think the server is ready to receive data when the client's active open completes successfully, before the server application has been notified of the new connection. If this happens, the server's TCP just queues the incoming data.
--

. If there is not enough room on the queue for the new connection, the TCP delays responding to the SYN, to give the application a chance to catch up.
+
Linux is somewhat unique in this behaviorâit persists in not ignoring incoming connections if it possibly can.
+
If the `net.ipv4.tcp_abort_on_overflow` system control variable is set, new incoming connections are reset with a reset segment.

[TIP]
====
Sending reset segments on overflow is not generally advisable and is not turned on by default.

* The client has attempted to contact the server, and if it receives a reset during the SYN exchange, it may falsely conclude that no server is present (instead of concluding that there is a server present but it is busy). Being too busy is really a form of "soft" or temporary error rather than a hard error.

* Normally, when the queue is full, the application or the operating system is busy, preventing the application from servicing incoming connections. This condition could change in a short while.

* But if the server's TCP responded with a reset, the client's active open would abort (which is what we saw happen if the server was not started).

* Without the reset, if the listening server does not get around to accepting some of the already-accepted connections that have filled its queue to the limit, the client's active open eventually times out, according to normal TCP mechanisms. In the case of Linux, the connecting clients are just slowed for a significant period of timeâthey will neither time out nor be reset.
