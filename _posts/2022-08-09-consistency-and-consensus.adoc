The simplest way of handling faults in distributed systems is to simply let the entire service fail, and show the user an error message. If that solution is unacceptable, we need to find ways of *_tolerating_* faults—that is, of keeping the service functioning correctly, even if some internal component is faulty.

The best way of building *_fault-tolerant_* systems is to find some general-purpose abstractions with useful guarantees, implement them once, and then let applications rely on those guarantees. This is the same approach as we used with transactions: by using a transaction, the application can pretend that there are no crashes (*_atomicity_*), that nobody else is concurrently accessing the database (*_isolation_*), and that storage devices are perfectly reliable (*_durability_*). Even though crashes, race conditions, and disk failures do occur, the transaction abstraction hides those problems so that the application doesn’t need to worry about them.

One of the most important abstractions for distributed systems is *_consensus_*: that is, getting all of the nodes to agree on something.

== Consistency Guarantees

If you look at two nodes in a replicated database at the same moment in time, you’re likely to see different data on the two nodes, because write requests arrive on different nodes at different times. These inconsistencies occur no matter what replication method the database uses (single-leader, multi-leader, or leaderless replication).

Most replicated databases provide at least *_eventual consistency_*, which means that if you stop writing to the database and wait for some unspecified length of time, then eventually all read requests will return the same value. In other words, the inconsistency is temporary, and it eventually resolves itself (assuming that any faults in the network are also eventually repaired). A better name for eventual consistency may be *_convergence_*, as we expect all replicas to eventually converge to the same value.

However, this is a very *_weak_* guarantee—it doesn’t say anything about *_when_* the replicas will converge. Until the time of convergence, reads could return anything or nothing.

But, *_stronger consistency models_* don’t come for free: systems with stronger guarantees may have *_worse performance_* or be *_less fault-tolerant_* than systems with weaker guarantees.

== Linearizability

In an eventually consistent database, if you ask two different replicas the same question at the same time, you may get two different answers. That’s confusing.

The idea behind *_linearizability_* (also known as *_atomic consistency_*, *_strong consistency_*, *_immediate consistency_*, or *_external consistency_* is to make a system appear as if there were only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic. With this guarantee, even though there may be multiple replicas in reality, the application does not need to worry about them.

In a linearizable system, as soon as one client successfully completes a write, all clients reading from the database must be able to see the value just written. Maintaining the illusion of a single copy of the data means guaranteeing that the value read is the most recent, up-to-date value, and doesn’t come from a stale cache or replica. In other words, linearizability is a *_recency guarantee_*.

=== What Makes a System Linearizable?

The basic idea behind linearizability is simple: to make a system appear as if there is *_only a single copy of the data_*.

Figure 9-2 shows three clients concurrently reading and writing the same key _x_ in a linearizable database. In the distributed systems literature, _x_ is called a *_register_*—in practice, it could be one key in a key-value store, one row in a relational database, or one document in a document database, for example.

image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-2_read_concurrent_with_a_write.png[,75%,75%]

For simplicity, Figure 9-2 shows only the requests from the clients’ point of view, not the internals of the database. Each bar is a request made by a client, where the start of a bar is the time when the request was sent, and the end of a bar is when the response was received by the client. Due to variable network delays, a client doesn’t know exactly when the database processed its request—it only knows that it must have happened sometime between the client sending the request and receiving the response.

In this example, the register has two types of operations:

* `read(x) ⇒ v` means the client requested to read the value of register _x_, and the database returned the value _v_.

* `write(x, v) ⇒ r` means the client requested to set the register _x_ to value _v_, and the database returned response _r_ (which could be _ok_ or _error_).

In Figure 9-2, the value of _x_ is initially 0, and client C performs a write request to set it to 1. While this is happening, clients A and B are repeatedly polling the database to read the latest value. What are the possible responses that A and B might get for their read requests?

* The first read operation by client A completes before the write begins, so it must definitely return the old value 0.

* The last read by client A begins after the write has completed, so it must definitely return the new value 1 if the database is linearizable: we know that the write must have been processed sometime between the start and end of the write operation, and the read must have been processed sometime between the start and end of the read operation. If the read started after the write ended, then the read must have been processed after the write, and therefore it must see the new value that was written.

* Any _read operations that overlap in time with the write operation_ might return either 0 or 1, because we don’t know whether or not the write has taken effect at the time when the read operation is processed. These operations are concurrent with the write.

However, that is not yet sufficient to fully describe linearizability: if reads that are concurrent with a write can return either the old or the new value, then readers could see a value *_flip back and forth_* between the old and the new value several times while a write is going on. That is not what we expect of a system that emulates a “single copy of the data.”

image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-3_read_after_write_new_value.png[,75%,75%]

In a linearizable system we imagine that there must be some point in time (between the start and end of the write operation) at which the value of _x_ *_atomically flips_* from 0 to 1. Thus, if one client’s read returns the new value 1, all subsequent reads must also return the new value, even if the write operation has not yet completed.

image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-4_visualizing_points_in_time_linearizability.png[,75%,75%]

In Figure 9-4 we add a third type of operation besides read and write:

* `cas(x, vold, vnew) ⇒ r` means the client requested an atomic compare-and-set operation. If the current value of the register _x_ equals vold, it should be atomically set to _vnew_. If _x ≠ vold_ then the operation should leave the register unchanged and return an error. _r_ is the database’s response (_ok_ or _error_).

The requirement of linearizability is that the lines joining up the operation markers always move forward in time (from left to right), never backward. This requirement ensures the recency guarantee: *_once a new value has been written or read, all subsequent reads see the value that was written, until it is overwritten again._*

.Linearizability Versus Serializability
[TIP]
====
Linearizability is easily confused with serializability, as both words seem to mean something like “can be arranged in a sequential order.” However, they are two quite different guarantees, and it is important to distinguish between them:

* *Serializability*
+
Serializability is an *_isolation property of transactions_*, where every transaction may read and write multiple objects (rows, documents, records). It guarantees that transactions behave the same as if they had executed in some serial order (each transaction running to completion before the next transaction starts). It is okay for that serial order to be different from the order in which transactions were actually run.

* *Linearizability*
+
Linearizability is a *_recency guarantee_* on reads and writes of a register (an individual object). It doesn’t group operations together into transactions, so it does not prevent problems such as write skew, unless you take additional measures such as materializing conflicts.

A database may provide both serializability and linearizability, and this combination is known as strict serializability or strong one-copy serializability (strong-1SR).

Implementations of serializability based on *_two-phase locking or actual serial execution are typically linearizable_*.

However, *_serializable snapshot isolation is not linearizable_*: by design, it makes reads from a consistent snapshot, to avoid lock contention between readers and writers. The whole point of a consistent snapshot is that it does not include writes that are more recent than the snapshot, and thus reads from the snapshot are not linearizable.
====

=== Relying on Linearizability

* *Locking and leader election*
+
A system that uses single-leader replication needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader, not several (split brain). One way of electing a leader is to use a lock: every node that starts up tries to acquire the lock, and the one that succeeds becomes the leader. No matter how this lock is implemented, it must be linearizable: all nodes must agree which node owns the lock; otherwise it is useless.
+
Coordination services like Apache *_ZooKeeper_* and *_etcd_* are often used to implement *_distributed locks_* and *_leader election_*. They use *_consensus algorithms_* to implement *_linearizable_* operations in a *_fault-tolerant_* way.

* *Constraints and uniqueness guarantees*
+
Uniqueness constraints are common in databases: for example, a username or email address must uniquely identify one user, and in a file storage service there cannot be two files with the same path and filename. If you want to enforce this constraint as the data is written (such that if two people try to concurrently create a user or a file with the same name, one of them will be returned an error), you need linearizability.

* *Cross-channel timing dependencies*
+
For example, say you have a website where users can upload a photo, and a background process resizes the photos to lower resolution for faster download (thumbnails). The architecture and dataflow of this system is illustrated in Figure 9-5.
+
The image resizer needs to be explicitly instructed to perform a resizing job, and this instruction is sent from the web server to the resizer via a message queue. The web server doesn’t place the entire photo on the queue, since most message brokers are designed for small messages, and a photo may be several megabytes in size. Instead, the photo is first written to a file storage service, and once the write is complete, the instruction to the resizer is placed on the queue.
+
image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-5_web_server_cross_channel_race_condition.png[,75%,75%]
+
If the file storage service is linearizable, then this system should work fine. If it is not linearizable, there is the risk of a race condition: the message queue (steps 3 and 4 in Figure 9-5) might be faster than the internal replication inside the storage service. In this case, when the resizer fetches the image (step 5), it might see an old version of the image, or nothing at all. If it processes an old version of the image, the full-size and resized images in the file storage become permanently inconsistent.
+
This problem arises because there are *_two different communication channels_* between the web server and the resizer: the file storage and the message queue. Without the recency guarantee of linearizability, race conditions between these two channels are possible.

=== Implementing Linearizable Systems

Since linearizability essentially means “behave as though there is *_only a single copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic_*,” the simplest answer would be to really only use a single copy of the data. However, that approach would not be able to tolerate faults: if the node holding that one copy failed, the data would be lost, or at least inaccessible until the node was brought up again.

The most common approach to making a system fault-tolerant is to use replication.

* *Single-leader replication (potentially linearizable)*
+
In a system with single-leader replication, the leader has the primary copy of the data that is used for writes, and the followers maintain backup copies of the data on other nodes. If you *_make reads from the leader_*, or from *_synchronously updated followers_*, they have the potential to be linearizable. However, not every single-leader database is actually linearizable, either by design (e.g., because it uses *_snapshot isolation_*) or due to *_concurrency bugs_*.
+
Using the leader for reads relies on the assumption that you know for sure who the leader is. It is quite possible for a node to think that it is the leader, when in fact it is not—and if the delusional leader continues to serve requests, it is likely to violate linearizability. With asynchronous replication, failover may even lose committed writes, which violates both durability and linearizability.

* *Consensus algorithms (linearizable)*
+
Some consensus algorithms bear a resemblance to single-leader replication. However, consensus protocols contain measures to prevent split brain and stale replicas. Thanks to these details, consensus algorithms can implement linearizable storage safely. This is how ZooKeeper and etcd work, for example.

* *Multi-leader replication (not linearizable)*
+
Systems with multi-leader replication are generally not linearizable, because they concurrently process writes on multiple nodes and asynchronously replicate
them to other nodes. For this reason, they can produce conflicting writes that require resolution. Such conflicts are an artifact of the lack of a single copy of the data.

* *Leaderless replication (probably not linearizable)*
+
For systems with leaderless replication (Dynamo-style), people sometimes claim that you can obtain “strong consistency” by requiring quorum reads and writes (w + r > n). Depending on the exact configuration of the quorums, and depending on how you define strong consistency, this is not quite true.
+
“Last write wins” conflict resolution methods based on time-of-day clocks (e.g., in Cassandra) are almost certainly nonlinearizable, because clock timestamps cannot be guaranteed to be consistent with actual event ordering due to clock skew. Sloppy quorums also ruin any chance of linearizability. Even with strict quorums, nonlinearizable behavior is possible.
+
Intuitively, it seems as though strict quorum reads and writes should be linearizable in a Dynamo-style model. However, when we have variable network delays, it is possible to have race conditions.
+
image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-6_nonlinearizable_strict_quorum.png[,75%,75%]
+
In summary, it is safest to assume that a leaderless system with Dynamo-style replication does not provide linearizability.

=== The Cost of Linearizability

image:/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-7_network_faults_linearizability_availablity.png[,75%,75%]

==== The CAP theorem

* If your application *_requires linearizability_*, and some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot
process requests while they are disconnected: they must either wait until the network problem is fixed, or return an error (either way, they become *_unavailable_*).

* If your application does *_not require linearizability_*, then it can be written in a way that each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replicas (e.g., multi-leader). In this case, the application can remain *_available_* in the face of a network problem, but its behavior is *_not linearizable_*.

Thus, applications that don’t require linearizability can be more tolerant of network problems. This insight is popularly known as the *_CAP theorem_*, named by Eric Brewer in 2000, although the trade-off has been known to designers of distributed databases since the 1970s.

.The Unhelpful CAP Theorem
[NOTE]
====
CAP is sometimes presented as *Consistency*, *Availability*, *Partition tolerance*: pick 2 out of 3. Unfortunately, putting it this way is misleading because network partitions are a kind of fault, so they aren’t something about which you have a choice: they will happen whether you like it or not.

At times when the network is working correctly, a system can provide both consistency (linearizability) and total availability. When a network fault occurs, you have to choose between either linearizability or total availability. Thus, a better way of phrasing CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned. A more reliable network needs to make this choice less often, but at some point the choice is inevitable.

In discussions of CAP there are several contradictory definitions of the term availability, and the formalization as a theorem does not match its usual meaning. Many so-called “highly available” (fault-tolerant) systems actually do not meet CAP’s idiosyncratic definition of availability. All in all, there is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion around CAP, and it does not help us understand systems better, so CAP is best avoided.
====

The CAP theorem as formally defined [30] is of very narrow scope: it only considers one consistency model (namely *_linearizability_*) and one kind of fault (*_network partitions_*, vi or nodes that are alive but disconnected from each other).

==== Linearizability and network delays

Although linearizability is a useful guarantee, surprisingly few systems are actually linearizable in practice. For example, even RAM on a modern multi-core CPU is not linearizable: if a thread running on one CPU core writes to a memory address, and a thread on another CPU core reads the same address shortly afterward, it is not guaranteed to read the value written by the first thread (unless a memory barrier or fence is used).

The reason for this behavior is that every CPU core has its own memory cache and store buffer. Memory access first goes to the cache by default, and any changes are asynchronously written out to main memory. Since accessing data in the cache is much faster than going to main memory, this feature is essential for good performance on modern CPUs. However, there are now several copies of the data (one in main memory, and perhaps several more in various caches), and these copies are asynchronously updated, so linearizability is lost.

Why make this trade-off? It makes no sense to use the CAP theorem to justify the multi-core memory consistency model: within one computer we usually assume reliable communication, and we don’t expect one CPU core to be able to continue operating normally if it is disconnected from the rest of the computer. The reason for dropping linearizability is *_performance_*, not fault tolerance.

The same is true of many distributed databases that choose not to provide linearizable guarantees: they do so primarily to increase performance, not so much for fault tolerance. Linearizability is slow—and this is true all the time, not only during a network fault.

Can’t we maybe find a more efficient implementation of linearizable storage? It seems the answer is no: Attiya and Welch prove that if you want linearizability, the response time of read and write requests is at least proportional to the uncertainty of delays in the network. In a network with highly variable delays, like most computer networks, the response time of linearizable reads and writes is inevitably going to be high. *_A faster algorithm for linearizability does not exist, but weaker consistency models can be much faster, so this trade-off is important for latency-sensitive systems._*

== Ordering Guarantees

* The main purpose of the leader in single-leader replication is to determine the *_order of writes_* in the replication log—that is, the order in which followers apply those writes.

* Serializability is about ensuring that transactions behave as if they were executed in some *_sequential order_*. It can be achieved by literally executing transactions in that serial order, or by allowing concurrent execution while preventing serialization conflicts (by locking or aborting).

* The use of timestamps and clocks in distributed systems is another attempt to introduce order into a disorderly world, for example to determine which one of two writes happened later.

=== Ordering and Causality

Causality imposes an ordering on events: cause comes before effect; a message is sent before that message is received; the question comes before the answer. And, like in real life, one thing leads to another: one node reads some data and then writes something as a result, another node reads the thing that was written and writes something else in turn, and so on. These chains of causally dependent operations define the *_causal order_* in the system—i.e., what happened before what.

==== The causal order is not a total order

A *_total order_* allows any two elements to be compared, so if you have two elements, you can always say which one is greater and which one is smaller. For example, natural numbers are totally ordered: if I give you any two numbers, say 5 and 13, you can tell me that 13 is greater than 5.

However, mathematical sets are not totally ordered: is {a, b} greater than {b, c}? Well, you can’t really compare them, because neither is a subset of the other. We say they are *_incomparable_*, and therefore mathematical sets are *_partially ordered_*: in some cases one set is greater than another (if one set contains all the elements of another), but in other cases they are incomparable.

* *Linearizability*
+
In a linearizable system, we have a total order of operations: if the system behaves as if there is only a single copy of the data, and every operation is atomic, this means that for any two operations we can always say which one happened first.

* *Causality*
+
We said that two operations are concurrent if neither *_happened before_* the other. Put another way, two events are ordered if they are causally related (one happened before the other), but they are incomparable if they are concurrent. This means that causality defines a partial order, not a total order: some operations are ordered with respect to each other, but some are incomparable.

Therefore, according to this definition, *_there are no concurrent operations in a linearizable datastore_*: there must be a single timeline along which all operations are totally ordered. There might be several requests waiting to be handled, but the datastore ensures that every request is handled atomically at a single point in time, acting on a single copy of the data, along a single timeline, without any concurrency.

==== Linearizability is stronger than causal consistency

So what is the relationship between the causal order and linearizability? The answer is any system that is linearizable will preserve causality correctly.

The fact that linearizability ensures causality is what makes linearizable systems simple to understand and appealing. However making a system linearizable can harm its performance and availability, especially if the system has significant network delays (for example, if it’s geographically distributed). For this reason, some distributed data systems have abandoned linearizability, which allows them to achieve better performance but can make them difficult to work with.

In many cases, systems that appear to require linearizability in fact only really require causal consistency, which can be implemented more efficiently. In fact, *_causal consistency_* is the strongest possible consistency model that does not slow down due to network delays, and remains available in the face of network failures.

==== Capturing causal dependencies

In order to maintain causality, you need to know which operation *_happened before_* which other operation. This is a *_partial order_*: concurrent operations may be processed in any order, but if one operation happened before another, then they must be processed in that order on every replica. Thus, when a replica processes an operation, it must ensure that all causally preceding operations (all operations that happened before) have already been processed; if some preceding operation is missing, the later operation must wait until the preceding operation has been processed.

=== Sequence Number Ordering

Although causality is an important theoretical concept, actually keeping track of all causal dependencies can become impractical. In many applications, clients read lots of data before writing something, and then it is not clear whether the write is causally dependent on all or only some of those prior reads. Explicitly tracking all the data that has been read would mean a large overhead.

However, there is a better way: we can *_use sequence numbers or timestamps to order events_*. A timestamp need not come from a time-of-day clock (or physical clock, which have many problems. It can instead come from a *_logical clock_*, which is an algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers to identify operations, typically using counters that are incremented for every operation.

Such sequence numbers or timestamps are compact (only a few bytes in size), and they provide a *_total order_*: that is, every operation has a unique sequence number, and you can always compare two sequence numbers to determine which is greater (i.e., which operation happened later).

In particular, we can create sequence numbers in a total order that is consistent with causality: we promise that if operation A causally happened before B, then A occurs before B in the total order (A has a lower sequence number than B). Concurrent operations may be ordered arbitrarily. Such a total order captures all the causality information, but also imposes more ordering than strictly required by causality.

In a database with single-leader replication, the replication log defines a total order of write operations that is consistent with causality. The leader can simply increment a counter for each operation, and thus assign a monotonically increasing sequence number to each operation in the replication log. If a follower applies the writes in the order they appear in the replication log, the state of the follower is always causally consistent (even if it is lagging behind the leader).

==== Noncausal sequence number generators

If there is not a single leader (perhaps because you are using a multi-leader or leaderless database, or because the database is partitioned), it is less clear how to generate sequence numbers for operations. Various methods are used in practice:

* Each node can generate its own independent set of sequence numbers. For example, if you have two nodes, one node can generate only odd numbers and the other only even numbers. In general, you could reserve some bits in the binary representation of the sequence number to contain a unique node identifier, and this would ensure that two different nodes can never generate the same sequence number.

* You can attach a timestamp from a time-of-day clock (physical clock) to each operation. Such timestamps are not sequential, but if they have sufficiently high resolution, they might be sufficient to totally order operations. This fact is used in the last write wins conflict resolution method.

* You can preallocate blocks of sequence numbers. For example, node A might claim the block of sequence numbers from 1 to 1,000, and node B might claim the block from 1,001 to 2,000. Then each node can independently assign sequence numbers from its block, and allocate a new block when its supply of sequence numbers begins to run low.

These three options all perform better and are more *_scalable_* than pushing all operations through a single leader that increments a counter. They generate a unique, approximately increasing sequence number for each operation. However, they all have a problem: the sequence numbers they generate are not consistent with causality.

==== Lamport timestamps

Although the three sequence number generators just described are inconsistent with causality, there is actually a simple method for generating sequence numbers that is consistent with causality. It is called a *_Lamport timestamp_*, proposed in 1978 by Leslie Lamport, in what is now one of the most-cited papers in the field of distributed systems.

The use of Lamport timestamps is illustrated in Figure 9-8. Each node has a unique identifier, and each node keeps a counter of the number of operations it has processed. The Lamport timestamp is then simply a pair of *_(counter, node ID)_*. Two nodes may sometimes have the same counter value, but by including the node ID in the timestamp, each timestamp is made unique.

image::/assets/consistency-and-consensus/Figure_9-8_lamport_timestamps.png[,75%,75%]

A Lamport timestamp bears no relationship to a physical time-of-day clock, but it provides total ordering: if you have two timestamps, the one with a greater counter value is the greater timestamp; if the counter values are the same, the one with the greater node ID is the greater timestamp.

The key idea about Lamport timestamps, which makes them consistent with causality, is the following: every node and every client keeps track of the maximum counter value it has seen so far, and includes that maximum on every request. When a node receives a request or response with a maximum counter value greater than its own counter value, it immediately increases its own counter to that maximum.

==== Timestamp ordering is not sufficient

Although Lamport timestamps define a total order of operations that is consistent with causality, they are not quite sufficient to solve many common problems in distributed systems.

For example, consider a system that needs to ensure that a username uniquely identifies a user account. If two users concurrently try to create an account with the same username, one of the two should succeed and the other should fail.

At first glance, it seems as though a total ordering of operations (e.g., using Lamport timestamps) should be sufficient to solve this problem: if two accounts with the same username are created, pick the one with the lower timestamp as the winner (the one who grabbed the username first), and let the one with the greater timestamp fail. Since timestamps are totally ordered, this comparison is always valid.

In order to be sure that no other node is in the process of concurrently creating an account with the same username and a lower timestamp, you would have to check with every other node to see what it is doing. If one of the other nodes has failed or cannot be reached due to a network problem, this system would grind to a halt. This is not the kind of fault-tolerant system that we need.

To conclude: in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for usernames, it’s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations—you also need to know when that order is finalized. If you have an operation to create a username, and you are sure that no other node can insert a claim for the same username ahead of your operation in the total order, then you can safely declare the operation successful.

=== Total Order Broadcast

If your program runs only on a single CPU core, it is easy to define a total ordering of operations: it is simply the order in which they were executed by the CPU. However, in a distributed system, getting all nodes to agree on the same total ordering of operations is tricky.

*_Total order broadcast_* or *_atomic broadcast_* is usually described as a protocol for exchanging messages between nodes. Informally, it requires that two safety properties always be satisfied:

* *Reliable delivery*
+
No messages are lost: if a message is delivered to one node, it is delivered to all nodes.

* *Totally ordered delivery*
+
Messages are delivered to every node in the same order.

A correct algorithm for total order broadcast must ensure that the reliability and ordering properties are always satisfied, even if a node or the network is faulty. Of course, messages will not be delivered while the network is interrupted, but an algorithm can keep retrying so that the messages get through when the network is eventually repaired (and then they must still be delivered in the correct order).

[NOTE]
====
Partitioned databases with a single leader per partition often maintain ordering only per partition, which means they cannot offer consistency guarantees (e.g., consistent snapshots, foreign key references) across partitions. Total ordering across all partitions is possible, but requires additional coordination.
====

==== Using total order broadcast

*_Consensus services_* such as *_ZooKeeper_* and *_etcd_* actually implement total order broadcast. This fact is a hint that there is a strong connection between total order
broadcast and consensus.

Total order broadcast is exactly what you need for *_database replication_*: if every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other (aside from any temporary replication lag). This principle is known as *_state machine replication_*.

Similarly, total order broadcast can be used to implement *_serializable transactions_*: if every message represents a deterministic transaction to be executed as a stored procedure, and if every node processes those messages in the same order, then the partitions and replicas of the database are kept consistent with each other.

An important aspect of total order broadcast is that the order is fixed at the time the messages are delivered: a node is not allowed to retroactively insert a message into an earlier position in the order if subsequent messages have already been delivered. This fact makes total order broadcast stronger than timestamp ordering.

Another way of looking at total order broadcast is that it is a way of creating a log (as in a replication log, transaction log, or write-ahead log): delivering a message is like appending to the log. Since all nodes must deliver the same messages in the same order, all nodes can read the log and see the same sequence of messages.

Total order broadcast is also useful for implementing a *_lock service_* that provides *_fencing tokens_*. Every request to acquire the lock is appended as a message to the log, and all messages are sequentially numbered in the order they appear in the log. The sequence number can then serve as a fencing token, because it is monotonically increasing. In ZooKeeper, this sequence number is called *_zxid_*.

==== Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast

Total order broadcast is asynchronous: messages are guaranteed to be delivered reliably in a fixed order, but there is no guarantee about when a message will be delivered (so one recipient may lag behind the others). By contrast, linearizability is a recency guarantee: a read is guaranteed to see the latest value written.

However, if you have total order broadcast, you can build linearizable storage on top of it. For example, you can ensure that usernames uniquely identify user accounts.

Imagine that for every possible username, you can have a linearizable register with an *_atomic compare-and-set operation_*. Every register initially has the value null (indicating that the username is not taken). When a user wants to create a username, you execute a compare-and-set operation on the register for that username, setting it to the user account ID, under the condition that the previous register value is null. If multiple users try to concurrently grab the same username, only one of the compare-and-set operations will succeed, because the others will see a value other than null (due to linearizability).

=== Implementing total order broadcast using linearizable storage

The algorithm is simple: for every message you want to send through total order broadcast, you increment-and-get the linearizable integer, and then attach the value you got from the register as a sequence number to the message. You can then send the message to all nodes (resending any lost messages), and the recipients will deliver the messages consecutively by sequence number.

How hard could it be to make a linearizable integer with an atomic increment-and-get operation? As usual, if things never failed, it would be easy: you could just keep it in a variable on one node. The problem lies in handling the situation when network connections to that node are interrupted, and restoring the value when that node fails. In general, if you think hard enough about linearizable sequence number generators, you inevitably end up with a consensus algorithm.
