The IP protocol alone provides no direct way for an end system to learn the fate of IP packets that fail to make it to their destinations.

In addition, IP provides no direct way of obtaining diagnostic information (e.g., which routers are used along a path or a method to estimate the round-trip time).

To address these deficiencies, a special protocol called the *Internet Control Message Protocol* (*ICMP*) [RFC0792] [RFC4443] is used in conjunction with IP to provide _diagnostics_ and _control_ information related to the configuration of the IP protocol layer and the disposition of IP packets.

ICMP is often considered part of the IP layer itself, and it is required to be present with any IP implementation. It uses the IP protocol for transport.

ICMP provides for the delivery of error and control messages that may require attention.

* ICMP messages are usually acted on by the IP layer itself, by higher-layer transport protocols (e.g., TCP or UDP), and in some cases by user applications.

* Note that ICMP does not provide reliability for IP.
+
Rather, it indicates certain classes of failures and configuration information.

* The most common cause of packet drops (buffer overrun at a router) does not elicit any ICMP information.
+
Other protocols, such as TCP, handle such situations.

Because of the ability of ICMP to affect the operation of important system functions and obtain configuration information, hackers have used ICMP messages in a large number of attacks. As a result of concerns about such attacks, network administrators often arrange to _block ICMP messages with firewalls_, especially at border routers. If ICMP is blocked, however, a number of common diagnostic utilities (e.g., _ping_, _traceroute_) do not work properly [RFC4890].

In IPv6, ICMPv6 is used for several purposes beyond simple error reporting and signaling.

* It is used for _Neighbor Discovery (ND)_ [RFC4861], which plays the same role as _ARP_ does for IPv4.
* It also includes the _Router Discovery_ function used for configuring hosts and _multicast address management_.
* Finally, it is also used to help manage handoffs in _Mobile IPv6_.

== Encapsulation in IPv4 and IPv6

.Encapsulation of ICMP messages in IPv4 and IPv6. The ICMP header contains a checksum covering the ICMP data area. In ICMPv6, the checksum also covers the Source and Destination IPv6 Address, Length, and Next Header fields in the IPv6 header.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv4-icmpv6-encapsulated-in-ip-packet-format.png[ICMP messages are encapsulated for transmission within IP datagrams,45%,45%]

* In IPv4, a _Protocol_ field value of _1_ indicates that the datagram caries ICMPv4.

* In IPv6, the ICMPv6 message may begin after zero or more extension headers. The last extension header before the ICMPv6 header includes a _Next Header_ field with value _58_.

* ICMP messages may be fragmented like other IP datagrams, although this is not common.

.All ICMP messages begin with 8-bit Type and Code fields, followed by a 16-bit Checksum that covers the entire message. The type and code values are different for ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

== ICMP Messages

ICMP messages are grouped into two major categories:

* those messages relating to problems with delivering IP datagrams (called _error messages_),
* and those related to information gathering and configuration (called _query_ or _informational messages_).

=== ICMPv4 Messages

For ICMPv4, the informational messages include

* _Echo Request_ and _Echo Reply_ (types _8_ and _0_, respectively),
* and _Router Advertisement_ and _Router Solicitation_ (types _9_ and _10_, respectively,
+
together called _Router Discovery_).

The most common error message types are

* _Destination Unreachable_ (type _3_),
* _Redirect_ (type _5_),
* _Time Exceeded_ (type _11_),
* and _Parameter Problem_ (type _12_).

=== Processing of ICMP Messages

In ICMP, the processing of incoming messages varies from system to system.

Generally speaking, the incoming informational requests are handled automatically by the operating system, and the error messages are delivered to user processes or to a transport protocol such as TCP [RFC5461]. The processes may choose to act on them or ignore them.

Exceptions to this general rule include the Redirect message and the Destination Unreachableâ€”Fragmentation Required messages.

* The former results in an automatic update to the host's routing table,
* whereas the latter is used in the path MTU discovery (PMTUD) mechanism, which is generally implemented by the transport-layer protocols such as TCP.

In ICMPv6 the handling of messages has been tightened somewhat. The following rules are applied when processing incoming ICMPv6 messages [RFC4443]:

. Unknown ICMPv6 error messages must be passed to the upper-layer process that produced the datagram causing the error (if possible).

. Unknown ICMPv6 informational messages are dropped.

. ICMPv6 error messages include as much of the original (_offending_) IPv6 datagram that caused the error as will fit without making the error message datagram exceed the minimum IPv6 MTU (1280 bytes).

. When processing ICMPv6 error messages, the upper-layer protocol type is extracted from the original or _offending_ packet (contained in the body of the ICMPv6 error message) and used to select the appropriate upper-layer process.
+
If this is not possible, the error message is silently dropped after any IPv6-layer processing.

. There are special rules for handling errors.

. An IPv6 node must limit the rate of ICMPv6 error messages it sends.
+
There are a variety of ways of implementing the rate-limiting function, including the _token bucket_ approach mentioned.

== ICMP Error Messages

In particular, an ICMP error message is not to be sent in response to any of the following messages: another ICMP error message, datagrams with bad headers (e.g., bad checksum), IP-layer broadcast/multicast datagrams, datagrams encapsulated in link-layer broadcast or multicast frames, datagrams with an invalid or network zero source address, or any fragment other than the first.

The reason for imposing these restrictions on the generation of ICMP errors is to limit the creation of so-called _broadcast storms_, a scenario in which the generation of a small number of messages creates an unwanted traffic cascade (e.g., by generating error responses in response to error responses, indefinitely).

An ICMPv4 error message is never generated in response to:

* An ICMPv4 error message. (An ICMPv4 error message may, however, be generated in response to an ICMPv4 query message.)
* A datagram destined for an IPv4 broadcast address or an IPv4 multicast address (formerly known as a class D address).
* A datagram sent as a link-layer broadcast.
* A fragment other than the first.
* A datagram whose source address does not define a single host.
+
This means that the source address cannot be a zero address, a loopback address, a broadcast address, or a multicast address.

An ICMPv6 error message is never generated in response to:

* An ICMPv6 error message
* An ICMPv6 Redirect message
* A packet destined for an IPv6 multicast address, with two exceptions:
** The Packet Too Big (PTB) message
** The Parameter Problem message (code 2)
* A packet sent as a link-layer multicast (with the exceptions noted previously)
* A packet sent as a link-layer broadcast (with the exceptions noted previously)
* A packet whose source address does not uniquely identify a single node.
+
This means that the source address cannot be an unspecified address, an IPv6 multicast address, or any address known by the sender to be an anycast address.

When an ICMP error message is sent, it contains

* a copy of the full IP header from the _offending_ or _original_ datagram (i.e., the IP header of the datagram that caused the error to be generated, including any IP options),
* plus any other data from the original datagram's IP payload area

such that the generated IP/ ICMP datagram's size does not exceed a specific value.

For IPv4 this value is _576_ bytes, and for IPv6 it is the IPv6 minimum MTU, which is at least _1280_ bytes.

Including a portion of the payload from the original IP datagram lets the receiving ICMP module associate the message with

* one particular _protocol_ (e.g., TCP or UDP) from the _Protocol_ or _Next Header_ field in the IP header
* and one particular _user process_ (from the TCP or UDP port numbers that are in the TCP or UDP header contained in the first 8 bytes of the IP datagram payload area).

=== Destination Unreachable (ICMPv4 Type 3, ICMPv6 Type 1) and Packet Too Big (ICMPv6 Type 2)

In ICMPv6, as compared with IPv4, the Fragmentation Required message has been replaced by an entirely different type (type 2), but the usage is very similar to the corresponding ICMP Destination Unreachable message.

==== ICMPv4 Host Unreachable (Code 1) and ICMPv6 Address Unreachable (Code 3)

This form of the Destination Unreachable message is generated by a router or host when it is required to send an IP datagram to a host using direct delivery but for some reason cannot reach the destination.

This situation may arise, for example, because the last-hop router is attempting to

* send an _ARP_ request to a host that is either missing or down.
