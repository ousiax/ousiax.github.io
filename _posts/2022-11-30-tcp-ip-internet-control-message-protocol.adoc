The IP protocol alone provides no direct way for an end system to learn the fate of IP packets that fail to make it to their destinations.

In addition, IP provides no direct way of obtaining diagnostic information (e.g., which routers are used along a path or a method to estimate the round-trip time).

To address these deficiencies, a special protocol called the *Internet Control Message Protocol* (*ICMP*) [RFC0792] [RFC4443] is used in conjunction with IP to provide _diagnostics_ and _control_ information related to the configuration of the IP protocol layer and the disposition of IP packets.

ICMP is often considered part of the IP layer itself, and it is required to be present with any IP implementation. It uses the IP protocol for transport.

ICMP provides for the delivery of error and control messages that may require attention.

* ICMP messages are usually acted on by the IP layer itself, by higher-layer transport protocols (e.g., TCP or UDP), and in some cases by user applications.

* Note that ICMP does not provide reliability for IP.
+
Rather, it indicates certain classes of failures and configuration information.

* The most common cause of packet drops (buffer overrun at a router) does not elicit any ICMP information.
+
Other protocols, such as TCP, handle such situations.

Because of the ability of ICMP to affect the operation of important system functions and obtain configuration information, hackers have used ICMP messages in a large number of attacks. As a result of concerns about such attacks, network administrators often arrange to _block ICMP messages with firewalls_, especially at border routers. If ICMP is blocked, however, a number of common diagnostic utilities (e.g., _ping_, _traceroute_) do not work properly [RFC4890].

In IPv6, ICMPv6 is used for several purposes beyond simple error reporting and signaling.

* It is used for _Neighbor Discovery (ND)_ [RFC4861], which plays the same role as _ARP_ does for IPv4.
* It also includes the _Router Discovery_ function used for configuring hosts and _multicast address management_.
* Finally, it is also used to help manage handoffs in _Mobile IPv6_.

== Encapsulation in IPv4 and IPv6

.Encapsulation of ICMP messages in IPv4 and IPv6. The ICMP header contains a checksum covering the ICMP data area. In ICMPv6, the checksum also covers the Source and Destination IPv6 Address, Length, and Next Header fields in the IPv6 header.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv4-icmpv6-encapsulated-in-ip-packet-format.png[ICMP messages are encapsulated for transmission within IP datagrams,45%,45%]

* In IPv4, a _Protocol_ field value of _1_ indicates that the datagram caries ICMPv4.

* In IPv6, the ICMPv6 message may begin after zero or more extension headers. The last extension header before the ICMPv6 header includes a _Next Header_ field with value _58_.

* ICMP messages may be fragmented like other IP datagrams, although this is not common.

.All ICMP messages begin with 8-bit Type and Code fields, followed by a 16-bit Checksum that covers the entire message. The type and code values are different for ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

== ICMP Messages

ICMP messages are grouped into two major categories:

* those messages relating to problems with delivering IP datagrams (called _error messages_),
* and those related to information gathering and configuration (called _query_ or _informational messages_).

=== ICMPv4 Messages

For ICMPv4, the informational messages include

* _Echo Request_ and _Echo Reply_ (types _8_ and _0_, respectively),
* and _Router Advertisement_ and _Router Solicitation_ (types _9_ and _10_, respectively,
+
together called _Router Discovery_).

The most common error message types are

* _Destination Unreachable_ (type _3_),
* _Redirect_ (type _5_),
* _Time Exceeded_ (type _11_),
* and _Parameter Problem_ (type _12_).

=== Processing of ICMP Messages

In ICMP, the processing of incoming messages varies from system to system.

Generally speaking, the incoming informational requests are handled automatically by the operating system, and the error messages are delivered to user processes or to a transport protocol such as TCP [RFC5461]. The processes may choose to act on them or ignore them.

Exceptions to this general rule include the Redirect message and the Destination Unreachableâ€”Fragmentation Required messages.

* The former results in an automatic update to the host's routing table,
* whereas the latter is used in the path MTU discovery (PMTUD) mechanism, which is generally implemented by the transport-layer protocols such as TCP.

In ICMPv6 the handling of messages has been tightened somewhat. The following rules are applied when processing incoming ICMPv6 messages [RFC4443]:

. Unknown ICMPv6 error messages must be passed to the upper-layer process that produced the datagram causing the error (if possible).

. Unknown ICMPv6 informational messages are dropped.

. ICMPv6 error messages include as much of the original (_offending_) IPv6 datagram that caused the error as will fit without making the error message datagram exceed the minimum IPv6 MTU (1280 bytes).

. When processing ICMPv6 error messages, the upper-layer protocol type is extracted from the original or _offending_ packet (contained in the body of the ICMPv6 error message) and used to select the appropriate upper-layer process.
+
If this is not possible, the error message is silently dropped after any IPv6-layer processing.

. There are special rules for handling errors.

. An IPv6 node must limit the rate of ICMPv6 error messages it sends.
+
There are a variety of ways of implementing the rate-limiting function, including the _token bucket_ approach mentioned.

== ICMP Error Messages

In particular, an ICMP error message is not to be sent in response to any of the following messages: another ICMP error message, datagrams with bad headers (e.g., bad checksum), IP-layer broadcast/multicast datagrams, datagrams encapsulated in link-layer broadcast or multicast frames, datagrams with an invalid or network zero source address, or any fragment other than the first.

The reason for imposing these restrictions on the generation of ICMP errors is to limit the creation of so-called _broadcast storms_, a scenario in which the generation of a small number of messages creates an unwanted traffic cascade (e.g., by generating error responses in response to error responses, indefinitely).

An ICMPv4 error message is never generated in response to:

* An ICMPv4 error message. (An ICMPv4 error message may, however, be generated in response to an ICMPv4 query message.)
* A datagram destined for an IPv4 broadcast address or an IPv4 multicast address (formerly known as a class D address).
* A datagram sent as a link-layer broadcast.
* A fragment other than the first.
* A datagram whose source address does not define a single host.
+
This means that the source address cannot be a zero address, a loopback address, a broadcast address, or a multicast address.

An ICMPv6 error message is never generated in response to:

* An ICMPv6 error message
* An ICMPv6 Redirect message
* A packet destined for an IPv6 multicast address, with two exceptions:
** The Packet Too Big (PTB) message
** The Parameter Problem message (code 2)
* A packet sent as a link-layer multicast (with the exceptions noted previously)
* A packet sent as a link-layer broadcast (with the exceptions noted previously)
* A packet whose source address does not uniquely identify a single node.
+
This means that the source address cannot be an unspecified address, an IPv6 multicast address, or any address known by the sender to be an anycast address.

When an ICMP error message is sent, it contains

* a copy of the full IP header from the _offending_ or _original_ datagram (i.e., the IP header of the datagram that caused the error to be generated, including any IP options),
* plus any other data from the original datagram's IP payload area

such that the generated IP/ ICMP datagram's size does not exceed a specific value.

For IPv4 this value is _576_ bytes, and for IPv6 it is the IPv6 minimum MTU, which is at least _1280_ bytes.

Including a portion of the payload from the original IP datagram lets the receiving ICMP module associate the message with

* one particular _protocol_ (e.g., TCP or UDP) from the _Protocol_ or _Next Header_ field in the IP header
* and one particular _user process_ (from the TCP or UDP port numbers that are in the TCP or UDP header contained in the first 8 bytes of the IP datagram payload area).

=== Destination Unreachable (ICMPv4 Type 3, ICMPv6 Type 1) and Packet Too Big (ICMPv6 Type 2)

In ICMPv6, as compared with IPv4, the Fragmentation Required message has been replaced by an entirely different type (type 2), but the usage is very similar to the corresponding ICMP Destination Unreachable message.

==== ICMPv4 Host Unreachable (Code 1) and ICMPv6 Address Unreachable (Code 3)

This form of the Destination Unreachable message is generated by a router or host when it is required to send an IP datagram to a host using direct delivery but for some reason cannot reach the destination.

This situation may arise, for example, because the last-hop router is attempting to

* send an _ARP_ request to a host that is either missing or down.

==== ICMPv4 Port Unreachable (Code 3) and ICMPv6 Port Unreachable (Code 4)

The Port Unreachable message is generated when an incoming datagram is destined for an application that is not ready to receive it.

This occurs most commonly in conjunction with UDP, when a message is sent to a port number that is not in use by any server process. If UDP receives a datagram and the destination port does not correspond to a port that some process has in use, UDP responds with an ICMP Port Unreachable message.

==== ICMPv4 PTB (Code 4)

If an IPv4 router receives a datagram that it intends to forward, and if the datagram does not fit into the MTU in use on the selected outgoing network interface, the datagram must be fragmented.

If the arriving datagram has the _Don't Fragment_ bit field set in its IP header, however, it is not forwarded but instead is dropped, and this ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable (PTB) message is generated.

* Because the router sending this message knows the MTU of the next hop, it is able to include the MTU value in the error message it generates.

* This message was originally intended to be used for network diagnostics but has since been used for path MTU discovery.

PMTUD is used to determine an appropriate packet size to use when communicating with a particular host, on the assumption that avoiding packet fragmentation is desirable. It is used most commonly with TCP.

==== ICMPv6 PTB (Type 2, Code 0)

In ICMPv6, a special message and type code combination is used to indicate that a packet is too large for the MTU of the next hop.

This message is not a Destination Unreachable message. Recall that in IPv6, packet fragmentation is performed only by the sender of a datagram and that MTU discovery is always supposed to be used.

==== ICMPv6 Beyond Scope of Source Address (Code 2)

IPv6 uses addresses of different scopes.

* Thus, it is possible to construct a packet with source and destination addresses of different scopes.
* Furthermore, it is possible that the destination address may not be reachable within the same scope.
+
For example, a packet with a source address using link-local scope may be destined for a globally scoped destination that requires traversal of more than one router.

Because the source address is of insufficient scope, the packet is dropped by a router, and this form of ICMPv6 error is produced to indicate the problem.

==== ICMPv6 Source Address Failed Ingress/Egress Policy (Code 5)

Code 5 is a more refined version of code 1, to be used when a particular ingress or egress filtering policy is the reason for prohibiting the successful delivery of a datagram.

This might be used, for example, when a host attempts to send traffic using a source IPv6 address from an unexpected network prefix [RFC3704].

==== ICMPv6 Reject Route to Destination (Code 6)

A _reject_ or _blocking route_ is a special routing or forwarding table entry, which indicates that matching packets should be dropped and an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable Reject Route message should be generated.

A similar type of entry called a _blackhole route_ also causes matching packets to be dropped, but usually without generating the Destination Unreachable message.

=== Redirect (ICMPv4 Type 5, ICMPv6 Type 137)

If a router receives a datagram from a host and can determine that it is not the correct next hop for the host to have used to deliver the datagram to its destination,

* the router sends a Redirect message to the host
* and sends the datagram on to the correct router (or host).

That is, if it can determine that

* there is a better next hop than itself for the given datagram,
* it redirects the host to update its forwarding table so that future traffic for the same destination will be directed toward the new node.

This facility provides a crude form of routing protocol by indicating to the IP forwarding function where to send its packets.

.The host incorrectly sends a datagram via R2 toward its destination. R2 realizes the hostâ€™s mistake and sends the datagram to the proper router, R1. It also informs the host of the error by sending an ICMP Redirect message. The host is expected to adjust its forwarding tables so that future datagrams to the same destination go through R1 without bothering R2.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmp-redirect-message.png[ICMP Redirect message,45%,45%]

The ICMP Redirect message includes the IP address of the router (or destination host, if it is reachable using direct delivery), a host should use as a next hop for
the destination specified in the ICMP error message.

.The ICMPv4 Redirect message includes the IPv4 address of the correct router to use as a next hop for the datagram included in the payload portion of the message. A host typically checks the IPv4 source address of the incoming Redirect message to verify that it is coming from the default router it is currently using.

.The ICMPv6 Redirect message. The target address indicates the IPv6 address of a better next-hop router for the node identified by the destination address. This message can also be used to indicate that the destination address is an on-link neighbor to the node sending the message that induced the error message. In this case, the destination and target addresses are the same.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-redirect-message-format.png[ICMPv6 Redirect Message,45%,45%]

In ICMPv6, the Redirect message (type 137) contains the target address and the destination address, and it is defined in conjunction with the ND process.

* The _Target Address_ field contains the correct node's link-local IPv6 address that should be used for the next hop.
* The _Destination Address_ is the destination IPv6 address in the datagram that evoked the redirect.

=== ICMP Time Exceeded (ICMPv4 Type 11, ICMPv6 Type 3)

Every IPv4 datagram has a _Time-to-Live (TTL)_ field in its IPv4 header, and every IPv6 datagram has a _Hop Limit_ field in its header. Any router must decrement the _TTL_ field by at least 1.

ICMP Time Exceeded (_code 0_) messages are generated when a router discards a datagram because the _TTL_ or _Hop Limit_ field is too low (i.e., arrives with value 0 or 1 and must be forwarded).

This message is important for the proper operation of the _traceroute_ tool (called _tracert_ on Windows).

.The ICMP Time Exceeded message format for ICMPv4 and ICMPv6. The message is standardized for both the TTL or hop count being exceeded (code 0) or the time for reassembling fragments exceeding some preconfigured threshold (code 1).
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmp-time-exceeded-message-format.png[ICMP Time Exceeded Message Format,45%,45%]

Another less common variant of this message is when a fragmented IP datagram only partially arrives at its destination (i.e., all its fragments do not arrive after a period of time).

In such cases, a variant of the ICMP Time Exceeded message (_code 1_) is used to inform the sender that its overall datagram has been discarded.

Recall that if any fragment of a datagram is dropped, the entire datagram is lost.

=== Parameter Problem (ICMPv4 Type 12, ICMPv6 Type 4)

ICMP Parameter Problem messages are generated by a host or router receiving an IP datagram containing some problem in its IP header that cannot be repaired.

When a datagram cannot be handled and no other ICMP message adequately describes the problem, this message acts as a sort of _catchall_ error condition indicator.

== ICMP Query/Informational Messages

The only remaining popular ICMP query/informational messages are the Echo Request/Response messages, more commonly called _ping_, and the Router Discovery messages.

Even the Router Discovery mechanism is not in wide use with IPv4, but its analog (part of Neighbor Discovery) in IPv6 is fundamental.

In addition, ICMPv6 has been extended to support Mobile IPv6 and the discovery of multicast-capable routers.

=== Echo Request/Reply (ping) (ICMPv4 Types 0/8, ICMPv6 Types 129/128)

One of the most commonly used ICMP message pairs is Echo Request and Echo Response (or Reply).

In ICMPv4 these are types 8 and 0, respectively, and in ICMPv6 they are types 128 and 129, respectively.

ICMP Echo Request messages may be of nearly arbitrary size (limited by the ultimate size of the encapsulating IP datagram).

With ICMP Echo Reply messages, the ICMP implementation is required to return any data received back to the sender, even if multiple IP fragments are involved.

As with other ICMP query/informational messages, the server must echo the _Identifier_ and _Sequence Number_ fields back in the reply.

.Format of the ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 Echo Request and Echo Reply messages. Any optional data included in a request must be returned in a reply. NATs use the _Identifier_ field to match requests with replies.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmp-echo-request-reply-message-format.png[Format of the ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 Echo Request and Echo Reply messages,45%,45%]

Implementations of ping set the _Identifier_ field in the ICMP message to some number that the sending host can use to demultiplex returned responses.

* In UNIX-based systems, for example, the process ID of the sending process is typically placed in the _Identifier_ field.
+
This allows the ping application to identify the returned responses if there are multiple instances of ping running at the same time on the same host, because the ICMP protocol does not have the benefit of transport-layer port numbers.

* This field is often known as the _Query Identifier_ field when referring to firewall behavior.

When a new instance of the ping program is run, the _Sequence Number_ field starts with the value 0 and is increased by 1 every time a new Echo Request message is sent.

* _ping_ prints the sequence number of each returned packet, allowing the user to see if packets are missing, reordered, or duplicated.
+
Recall that IP (and consequently ICMP) is a _best-effort_ datagram delivery service, so any of these three conditions can occur.
+
ICMP does, however, include a data checksum not provided by IP.

The _ping_ program also typically includes a copy of the local time in the optional data area of outgoing echo requests.

* This time, along with the rest of the contents of the data area, is returned in an Echo Response message.
* The _ping_ program notes the current time when a response is received and subtracts the time in the reply from the current time, giving an estimate of the _RTT_ to reach the host that was _pinged_.
* Because only the original sender's notion of the current time is used, this feature does not require any synchronization between the clocks at the sender and receiver.
* A similar approach is used by the _traceroute_ tool for its _RTT_ measurements.

=== Router Discovery: Router Solicitation and Advertisement (ICMPv4 Types 9, 10)

_DHCP_ can be used for a host to acquire an IP address and learn about the existence of nearby routers.

An alternative option for learning about routers is called _Router Discovery (RD)_.

Although specified for configuring both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, it is not widely used with IPv4 because of widespread preference for DHCP.

Router Discovery for IPv4 is accomplished using a pair of ICMPv4 informational messages [RFC1256]: _Router Solicitation_ (RS, type 10) and _Router Advertisement_ (RA, type 9).

* First, they are periodically multicast on the local network (using TTL = 1) to the _All Hosts multicast address_ (_224.0.0.1_),

* and they are also provided to hosts on demand that ask for them using RS messages. RS messages are sent using multicast to the _All Routers multicast address_ (_224.0.0.2_).

The primary purpose of Router Discovery is for a host to learn about all the routers on its local subnetwork, so that it can choose a default route among them.

It is also used to discover the presence of routers that are willing to act as _Mobile IP home agents_.

=== Multicast Listener Query/Report/Done (ICMPv6 Types 130/131/132)

_Multicast Listener Discovery_ (MLD) [RFC2710][RFC3590] provides management of multicast addresses on links using IPv6. It is similar to the _IGMP_ protocol used by IPv4.

.ICMPv6 MLD version 1 messages are all of this form.Queries (type 130) are either general or multicast-address-specific. General queries ask hosts to report which multicast addresses they have in use, and address-specific queries are used to determine if a specific address is (still) in use. The maximum response time gives the maximum number of milliseconds a host may delay sending a report in response to a query. The destination multicast address is 0 for general queries and the multicast address in question for specific reports. For Report (type 131) and Done messages (type 132), it includes the address related to the report or what address is no longer of interest, respectively.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-mld-message-v1.png[ICMPv6 MLD Message V1,55%,55%]

The main purpose of MLD is for multicast routers to learn the multicast addresses used by the hosts on each link to which they are mutually attached.

MLDv2 extends this capability by allowing hosts to specify particular hosts from which they wish to (or not to) receive traffic.

Two forms of MLD queries (type 130) are sent by multicast routers: _general queries_ and _multicast-address-specific queries_.

Generally, routers send the query messages and hosts respond with reports, either in response to the queries, or unsolicited if a host's multicast address membership changes.

The _Maximum Response Time_ field, nonzero only in queries, gives the maximum number of milliseconds a host may delay sending a report in response to a query.

The _Multicast Address_ field is 0 for general queries and the address for which the router is interested in reports otherwise.

For MLD Report messages (type 131) and MLD Done messages (type 132) it includes the address related to the report or what address is no longer of interest, respectively.

=== Version 2 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2) (ICMPv6 Type 143)

MLDv2 extends the MLD Query message with additional information pertaining to specific sources. The first 24 bytes of the message are identical to the common MLD format.

== Neighbor Discovery in IPv6

The _Neighbor Discovery Protocol_ in IPv6 (sometimes abbreviated as NDP or ND) [RFC4861] brings together the _Router Discovery_ and _Redirect_ mechanisms of ICMPv4 with the address-mapping capabilities provided by _ARP_.

It is also specified for use in supporting _Mobile IPv6_.

In contrast to ARP and IPv4, which generally use broadcast addressing (except for Router Discovery), ICMPv6 makes extensive use of multicast addressing, at both the network and link layers. (Recall that IPv6 does not even have broadcast addresses.)

ND is designed to allow nodes (routers and hosts) on the same link or segment to find each other, determine if they have bidirectional connectivity, and determine if a neighbor has become inoperative or unavailable. It also supports _stateless address autoconfiguration_. All of the ND functionality is provided by ICMPv6 at or above the network layer, making it largely independent of the particular link-layer technology employed underneath. However, ND does prefer to make use of link-layer multicast capabilities, and for this reason operation on non-broadcast- and non-multicast-capable link layers (called non-broadcast multiple access or NBMA links) may differ somewhat.

The two main parts of ND are 

* _Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement (NS/NA)_, which provides the ARP-like function of mapping between network- and link-layer addresses,

* and _Router Solicitation/Advertisement (RS/RA)_, which provides the functions of router discovery, Mobile IP agent discovery, and redirects, as well as some support for autoconfiguration.

A secure variant of ND called SEND [RFC3971] adds authentication and special forms of addressing, primarily by introducing additional ND options.

ND messages are ICMPv6 messages sent using an IPv6 Hop Limit field value of 255. Receivers verify that incoming ND messages have this value to protect against off-link senders that may attempt to spoof local ICMPv6 messages (such messages would arrive with values less than 255).

=== ICMPv6 Router Solicitation and Advertisement (ICMPv6 Types 133, 134)

*Router Advertisement (RA)* messages indicate the presence and capabilities of a nearby router.

They are sent periodically by routers, or in response to a *Router Solicitation (RS) message*.

.The ICMPv6 Router Solicitation message is very simple but ordinarily contains a Source Link-Layer Address option (unlike its ICMPv4 counterpart). It may also contain an MTU option if an unusual MTU value is in use on the link.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-rs-message.png[ICMPv6 Router Solicitation message,55%,55%]

The RS message is used to induce on-link routers to send RA messages. RS messages are sent to the _All Routers multicast address_, _ff02::2_. A Source Link-Layer Address option is supposed to be included if the sender of the message is using an IPv6 address other than the unspecified address (used during autoconfiguration). It is the only valid option for such messages as of [RFC4861].

.An ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message is sent to the All Nodes multicast address (ff02::1). Receiving nodes check to make sure that the Hop Limit field is 255, ensuring that the packet has not been forwarded through a router. The message includes three flags: M (Managed address configuration), O (Other stateful configuration), and H (Home Agent).
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-ra-message.png[ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message,55%,55%]

The Router Advertisement (RA) message is sent by routers to the _All Nodes multicast address_ (_ff02::1_) or the _unicast address_ of the requesting host, if the advertisement is sent in response to a solicitation. RA messages inform local hosts and other routers of configuration details relevant to the local link.

=== ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement (IMCPv6 Types 135, 136)

The *Neighbor Solicitation (NS)* message in ICMPv6 effectively replaces the _ARP Request_ messages used with IPv4.

* Its primary purpose is to convert IPv6 addresses to link-layer addresses.
+
When used to determine address mappings, it is sent to the _Solicited-Node multicast address_ corresponding to the IPv6 address contained in the _Target Address_ field (prefix _f02::1:f/104_, combined with the low-order 24 bits of the solicited IPv6 address).

* However, it is also used for detecting whether nearby nodes can be reached, and if they can be reached bidirectionally (that is, whether the nodes can talk to each other).
+
When this message is used to determine connectivity to a neighbor, it is sent to that neighbor's IPv6 unicast address instead of the Solicited-Node address.

.The ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message is similar to the RS message but contains a target IPv6 address. These messages are sent to Solicited-Node multicast addresses to provide ARP-like functionality and to unicast addresses to test reachability to other nodes. NS messages contain a Source Link-Layer Address option on links that use lower-layer addressing.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-ns-message.png[ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message,55%,55%]

The NS message contains the IPv6 address for which the sender is trying to learn the link-layer address.

* The message may contain the _Source Link-Layer Address_ option.
+
This option must be included in networks that use link-layer addressing when the solicitation is sent to a multicast address and should be included for unicast solicitations.

* If the sender of the message is using the unspecified address as its source address (e.g., during duplicate address detection), this option is not to be included.

.The ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement message contains the following flags: _R_ indicates that the sender is a router, _S_ indicates that the advertisement is a response to a solicitation, and _O_ indicates that the message contents should override other cached address mappings. The _Target Address_ field contains the IPv6 address of the sender of the message (generally, the unicast address of the solicited node from the ND solicitation). A _Target Link-Layer Address_ option is included to enable ARP-like functionality for IPv6.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-na-message.png[ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement message,55%,55%]

The ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message serves the purpose of the ARP Response message in IPv4 in addition to helping with neighbor unreachability detection .

* It is either sent as a response to an NS message or sent asynchronously when a node's IPv6 address changes.
+
It is sent either to

** the unicast address of the soliciting node,
** or to the _All Nodes multicast address_ if the soliciting node used the unspecified address as its source address.

* The _R (Router)_ field indicates that the sender of the message is a router.
+
This could change, for example, if a router ceases being a router and becomes only a host instead.

* The _S (Solicited)_ field indicates that the advertisement is in response to a solicitation received earlier.
+
This field is used to verify that bidirectional connectivity between neighbors has been achieved.

* The _O (Override)_ field indicates that information in the advertisement should override any previously cached information the receiver of the message has.
+
It is not supposed to be set for solicited advertisements, for anycast addresses, or in solicited proxy advertisements.
+
It is supposed to be set in other (solicited or unsolicited) advertisements.

* For solicited advertisements, the _Target Address_ field is the IPv6 address being looked up.
+
For unsolicited advertisements, it is the IPv6 address that corresponds to a link-layer address that has changed.
+
This message must contain the _Target Link-Layer Address_ option on networks that support link-layer addressing when the advertisement was solicited via a multicast address.

=== ICMPv6 Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation/Advertisement (ICMPv6 Types 141/142)

The _Inverse Neighbor Discovery_ (IND) facility in IPv6 [RFC3122] originated from a need to determine IPv6 addresses given link-layer addresses on Frame Relay networks.

It resembles _reverse ARP_, a protocol once used with IPv4 networks primarily for supporting diskless computers.

Its main function is to ascertain the networklayer address(es) corresponding to a known link-layer address.

.The ICMPv6 IND Solicitation (type 141) and Advertisement (type 142) messages have the same basic format. They are used to map known link-layer addresses to IPv6 addresses in environments where this is useful.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/icmpv6-ind-solicitation-advertisement-message.png[ICMPv6 IND Message,45%,45%]

* The IND Solicitation message is sent to the _All Nodes multicast address_ at the IPv6 layer but is encapsulated in a unicast link-layer address (the one being looked up).

* It must contain both a _Source Link-Layer Address_ option and a _Destination Link-Layer Address_ option.

* It may also contain a _Source/Target Address List_ option and/or an _MTU_ option.

=== Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD)

One of the important features of ND is to detect when reachability between two systems on the same link has become lost or asymmetric (i.e., is not available in both directions).

This is accomplished using the *Neighbor Unreachability Detection* (NUD) algorithm. It is used to manage the _neighbor cache_ present on each node.

The neighbor cache is analogous to the ARP cache; it is a (conceptual) data structure that holds the IPv6-to-link-layer-address mapping information required to perform direct delivery of IPv6 datagrams to on-link neighbors as well as information regarding the state of the mapping.

.Neighbor Unreachability Detection helps maintain the neighbor cache consisting of several neighbor entries. Each entry is in one of five states at any given time. Confirmations of reachability are accomplished by receiving Neighbor Advertisement messages or using other higher-layer protocol information, if available. Unsolicited evidence includes unsolicited Neighbor and Router Advertisement messages.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/internet-control-message-protocol/nud-neighbor-cache-states.png[NUD Neighbor Cache States,55%,55%]

Each mapping may be in one of five states: INCOMPLETE, REACHABLE, STALE, DELAY, or PROBE.

* The transition diagram shows the initial states to be either INCOMPLETE or STALE.

* When an IPv6 node has a unicast datagram to send to a destination, it checks its destination cache to see if an entry corresponding to the destination is present.

** If so, and the destination is on-link, the neighbor cache is consulted to see if the neighbor's state is REACHABLE.
+
If so, the datagram is sent using direct delivery.

** If no neighbor cache entry is present but the destination appears to be on-link, NUD enters the INCOMPLETE state and sends an NS message.
+
Successful receipt of a solicited NA message provides confirmation that the node is reachable, and the entry enters the REACHABLE state.

* The STALE state corresponds to apparently valid entries that have not yet been confirmed.
+
This state is entered 

** when either an entry has not been updated for some time when it was previously REACHABLE,
** or when unsolicited information is received (e.g., a node has changed its address and sent an unsolicited NA message).
+
These cases suggest that reachability is possible, but confirmation in the form of a valid NA is still required.

* The other states, DELAY and PROBE, are temporary states.

** DELAY is used when a packet is sent but ND has no current evidence to suggest that reachability is possible.
+
The state gives upper-layer protocols an opportunity to provide additional evidence.

** If after DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME seconds (the constant 5) no evidence is received, the state changes to PROBE.

** In the PROBE state, ND sends periodic NS messages (every RetransTimer milliseconds, with constant default value RETRANS_ TIMER equal to 1000).
+
If no evidence has been received after sending MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT NS messages (default 3), the entry is supposed to be deleted.
