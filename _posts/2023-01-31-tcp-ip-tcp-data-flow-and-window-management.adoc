We now examine the dynamics of TCP data transfers, focusing initially on _interactive_ connections and then introducing flow control and associated window management procedures that are used in conjunction with congestion control for bulk data transfers (i.e., _noninteractive_ communications).

An _interactive_ TCP connection is one in which user input such as keystrokes, short messages, or joystick/mouse movements need to be delivered between a client and a server.

* If small segments are used to carry such user input, the protocol imposes more overhead because there are fewer useful payload bytes per packet exchanged.
* On the other hand, filling packets with more data usually requires them to be delayed, which can have a negative impact on delay-sensitive applications such as online games and collaboration tools.

== Interactive Communication

Studies of TCP traffic usually find that 90% or more of all TCP segments contain _bulk data_ (e.g., Web, file sharing, electronic mail, backups) and the remaining portion contains _interactive data_ (e.g., remote login, network games).

* Bulk data segments tend to be relatively large (1500 bytes or larger), while interactive data segments tend to be much smaller (tens of bytes of user data).

* TCP handles both types of data using the same protocol and packet format, but different algorithms come into play for each.

Let us look at the flow of data when we type an interactive command on an ssh connection.

TIP: Secure shell (`ssh`) is a remote login protocol that provides strong security (privacy and authentication based on cryptography). It has mostly replaced the earlier UNIX `rlogin` and Telnet programs that provide remote login service but without strong security.

.One possible way to remotely echo an interactive keystroke is a separate ACK and echo packet (a). A typical TCP coalesces the ACK for the data byte and the echo of the byte into a single packet (using _delayed acknowledgments_ with _piggybacking_) (b).

== Delayed Acknowledgments

In many cases, TCP does not provide an ACK for every incoming packet because of TCP's cumulative ACK field.

Using a cumulative ACK allows TCP to intentionally _delay_ sending an ACK for some amount of time, in the hope that it can combine the ACK it needs to send with some data the local application wishes to send in the other direction. This is a form of *piggybacking* that is used most often in conjunction with bulk data transfers.

[NOTE]
====
The Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122] states that TCP should implement a delayed ACK but the delay must be less than 500ms. Many implementations use a maximum of 200ms.
====

Delaying ACKs causes less traffic to be carried over the network than when ACKs are not delayed because fewer ACKs are used. A ratio of 2 to 1 is fairly common for bulk transfers. The use of delayed ACKs and the maximum amount of time TCP is allowed to wait before sending an ACK can be configured, depending on the host operating system.

Linux uses a dynamic adjustment algorithm whereby it can change between ACKing every segment (called _quickack_ mode) and conventional delayed ACK mode.

[TIP]
====
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, there are two modes used by TCP to acknowledge data reception: <<RHELDELACK>>

* Quick ACK
+
This mode is used at the start of a TCP connection so that the congestion window can grow quickly.
+
The acknowledgment (ACK) timeout interval (ATO) is set to `tcp_ato_min`, the minimum timeout value.
+
To change the default TCP ACK timeout value, write the required value in milliseconds to the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ato_min` file:
+
[source,console]
~]# echo 4 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ato_min

* Delayed ACK
+
After the connection is established, TCP assumes this mode, in which ACKs for multiple received packets can be sent in a single packet.
+
ATO is set to `tcp_delack_min` to restart or reset the timer.
+
To change the default TCP Delayed ACK value, write the required value in milliseconds to the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_delack_min` file:
+
[source,console]
~]# echo 4 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_delack_min

TCP switches between the two modes depending on the current congestion.

== Nagle Algorithm

When using IPv4, sending one single key press across an ssh connection generates TCP/IPv4 packets of about 88 bytes in size (using the encryption and authentication from the example): 20 bytes for the IP header, 20 bytes for the TCP header (assuming no options), and 48 bytes of data.

These small packets (called _tinygrams_) have a relatively high overhead for the network beacuse they contain relatively little useful application data compared to the rest of the packet contents.

* Such high-overhead packets are normally not a problem on LANs, because most LANs are not congested and such packets would not need to be carried very far.

* However, these tinygrams can add to congestion and lead to inefficient use of capacity on wide area networks.

* A simple and elegant solution was proposed by John Nagle in [RFC0896], now called the _Nagle algorithm_.

The *Nagle algorithm* says that when a TCP connection has outstanding data that has not yet been acknowledged, small segments (those smaller than the SMSS) cannot be sent until all outstanding data is acknowledged.

* Instead, small amounts of data are collected by TCP and sent in a single segment when an acknowledgment arrives.
+
This procedure effectively forces TCP into _stop-and-wait_ behaviorâ€”it stops sending until an ACK is received for any outstanding data.

* The beauty of this algorithm is that it is _self-clocking_: the faster the ACKs come back, the faster the data is sent.
+
On a comparatively high-delay WAN, where reducing the number of tinygrams is desirable, fewer segments are sent per unit time. Said another way, the RTT controls the packet sending rate.

To illustrate the effect of the Nagle algorithm, we can compare the behaviors of an application using TCP with the Nagle algorithm enabled and disabled.

Using a connection with a relatively large RTT of about 190ms, we can see the differences.

[TIP]
====
Using the `tc` to emulate the network delay on the destination server:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo tc qdisc add dev ens32 root netem delay 190ms
$ sudo tc qdisc show dev ens32
qdisc netem 8001: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 190.0ms
----

First, we examine the case with typing a `date` command when Nagle is disabled (the default for ssh):

An ssh trace showing a TCP connection with a 190ms RTT and the Nagle algorithm in
operation. Requests are followed in lockstep with responses, and the exchange takes
0.80s using 11 packets.

* Nagle algorithm forces TCP to operate in a stop-and-wait fashion, so that the TCP sender cannot proceed until ACKs are received.

* If we look at the times for each request/response pairâ€”0.0, 0.19, 0.19, and 0.38â€”we see that they follow a pattern; each is separated by almost exactly 190ms, which is very close to the RTT of the connection.
+
This is the trade-off the Nagle algorithm makes: fewer and larger packets are used, but the required delay is higher.

.Comparing the use of the Nagle algorithm for TCP connections with a similar operating environment. With Nagle enabled, at most one packet is allowed to be outstanding at any given time. This reduces the number of small packets but increases delay.
