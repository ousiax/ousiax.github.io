When a router is forced to discard data because it cannot handle the arriving traffic rate, is called *congestion*. A router is said to be _congested_ when it is in this state, and even a single connection can drive one or more routers into congestion.

Left unaddressed, congestion can cause the performance of a network to be reduced so badly that it becomes unusable. In the very worst cases, it is said to be in a state of _congestion collapse_.

To either avoid or at least react effectively to mitigate this situation, each TCP implements *congestion control procedures*.

Congestion control is a set of behaviors determined by algorithms that each TCP implements in an attempt to prevent the network from being overwhelmed by too large an aggregate offered traffic load.

The basic approach is to have TCP slow down when it has reason to believe the network is about to be congested (or is already so congested that routers are discarding packets).

The challenge is to determine exactly when and how TCP should slow down, and when it can speed up again.

[NOTE]
====
In today's wired networks, packet loss is caused primarily by congestion in routers or switches.

With wireless networks, transmission and reception errors become a significant cause of packet loss.

Determining whether loss is due to congestion or transmission errors has been an active research topic since the mid-1990s when wireless networks started to attain widespread use.
====

A value used to hold the estimate of the network's available capacity is called the *_congestion window_*, written more compactly as simply _cwnd_.

A sender's actual (usable) window _W_ is then written as the minimum of the receiver's advertised window _awnd_ and the congestion window:

[.text-center,subs="+quotes"]
----
_W_ = min(_cwnd_, _awnd_)
----

With this relationship, the TCP sender is not permitted to have more than _W_ unacknowledged packets or bytes outstanding in the network.

The total amount of data a sender has introduced into the network for which it has not yet received an acknowledgment is sometimes called the _flight size_, which is always less than or equal to _W_.

In general, _W_ can be maintained in either packet or byte units.

This all seems logical but is far from the whole story. 

Because both the state of the network and the state of the receiver change with time, the values of both _awnd_ and _cwnd_ change over time.

In addition, because of the lack of explicit signals, the correct value of _cwnd_ is generally not directly available to the sending TCP. Thus, all of the values _W_, _cwnd_, and _awnd_ must be empirically determined and dynamically updated.

In addition, as we said before, we do not want _W_ to be too big or too smallâ€”we want it to be set to about the _bandwidth-delay product_ (BDP) of the network path, also called the _optimal_ window size. This is the amount of data that can be stored in the network in transit to the receiver.

On the Internet, determining the BDP for a connection can be challenging, given that routes, delay, and the level of statistical multiplexing (i.e., sharing of capacity) change as a function of time.

[NOTE]
====
Although handling congestion at the TCP sender is our primary area of interest, work has been done on handling the cases where congestion occurs on the reverse path, because of ACKs.

In [RFC5690] a method is introduced to inform a TCP receiver of the ACK ratio it should use (i.e., how many packets it should receive before sending an ACK).

== The Classic Algorithms

When a new TCP connection first starts out, it usually has no idea what the initial value for _cwnd_ should be, as it has no idea how much network capacity is available for it to send its data.

TCP learns the value for _awnd_ with one packet exchange to the receiver, but without any explicit signaling, the only obvious way it has to learn a good value for _cwnd_ is to try sending data at faster and faster rates until it experiences a packet drop (or other congestion indicator).

This could be accomplished by either sending immediately at the maximum rate it can (subject to the value of _awnd_), or it could start more slowly.

Because of the detrimental effects on the performance of other TCP connections sharing the same network path that could be experienced when starting at full rate, a TCP generally uses one algorithm to avoid starting so fast when it starts up to get to steady state. It uses a different one once it is in steady state.

The operation of TCP congestion control at a sender is driven or clocked by the receipt of ACKs.

If a TCP is operating at steady state (with an appropriate value of _cwnd_), receipt of an ACK indicates that one or more packets have been removed from the network, and consequently that an opportunity to send more has arisen.

Following this line of reasoning, the TCP congestion behavior in steady state attempts to achieve a _conservation of packets_ in the network.

.TCP congestion control operates on a principle of conservation of packets. Packets (P~b~) are stretched out in time as they are sent from sender to receiver over links with constrained capacity. As they are received at the receiver spaced apart (P~r~), ACKs are generated (A~r~), which return to the sender. ACKs traveling from receiver to sender become spaced out (A~b~) in relation to the inter-packet spacing of the packets. When ACKs reach the sender (A~s~), their arrivals provide a signal or _ACK clock_, used to tell the sender it is time to send more. In steady state, the overall system is said to be _self-clocked_.
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-congestion-control/conservation-of-packets.png[Conservation of Packets,55%,55%]

* The top funnel holds (larger) data packets traveling along the path from the sender to the receiver.
* The comparatively narrow width of the funnel depicts how packets are _stretched out_ in time as they travel through a relatively slow link.
* The ends of the funnels (at sender and receiver) show the queues where packets are held before or after they travel along the path.
* The bottom funnel holds the ACKs sent by the receiver back to the sender that correspond to the data packets in the top funnel.
* When operating efficiently at steady state, there are no bunches of packets in the top or bottom funnels.
* In addition, there is no significant extra space between packets in the top funnel.
* Note that an arrival of an ACK at the sender _liberates_ another data packet to be sent into the top funnel, and that this happens at just the right time (i.e., when the network is able to accept another packet).
* This relationship is sometimes called _self-clocking_, because the arrival of an ACK, called the _ACK clock_, triggers the system to take the action of sending another packet.

=== Slow Start

The slow start algorithm is executed when a new TCP connection is created or when a loss has been detected due to a retransmission timeout (RTO). It may also be invoked after a sending TCP has gone idle for some time.

* The purpose of slow start is to help TCP find a value for _cwnd_ before probing for more available bandwidth using congestion avoidance and to establish the ACK clock.

* Typically, a TCP begins a new connection in slow start, eventually drops a packet, and then settles into steady-state operation using the congestion avoidance algorithm.

To quote from <<RFC5681>>:

> Beginning transmission into a network with unknown conditions requires TCP to slowly probe the network to determine the available capacity, in order to avoid congesting the network with an inappropriately large burst of data. The slow start algorithm is used for this purpose at the beginning of a transfer, or after repairing loss detected by the retransmission timer.

TCP begins in slow start by sending a certain number of segments (after the SYN exchange), called the _initial window_ (IW).

The value of _IW_ was originally one _SMSS_, although with <<RFC5681>> it is allowed to be larger.

NOTE: Note that in most cases _SMSS_ is equal to the smaller of the receiver's MSS and the path MTU (less header sizes).

Assuming no packets are lost and each packet causes an ACK to be sent in response, an ACK is returned for the first segment, allowing the sending TCP to send another segment.

However, slow start operates by incrementing _cwnd_ by min(_N_, SMSS) for each good ACK received, where _N_ is the number of previously unacknowledged bytes ACKed by the received _good ACK_.

TIP: A _good ACK_ is one that returns a higher ACK number than has been seen so far.

Thus, after one segment is ACKed, the _cwnd_ value is ordinarily increased to 2, and two segments are sent. If each of those causes new good ACKs to be returned, 2 increases to 4, 4 to 8, and so on.

* In general, assuming no loss and an ACK for every packet, the value of _W_ after _k_ round-trip exchanges is W = 2^k^.

* Rewriting, we can say that _k_ = log~2~_W_ RTTs are required to reach an operating window of _W_.

This growth seems quite fast (increasing as an exponential function) but is still slower than what TCP would do if it were allowed to send immediately a window of packets equal in size to the receiver's advertised window. Recall that _W_ is still never allowed to exceed _awnd_.

Eventually, cwnd (and thus _W_) could become so large that the corresponding window of packets sent overwhelms the network (recall that TCP's throughput rate is proportional to _W/RTT_).

* When this happens, _cwnd_ is reduced substantially (to half of its former value).

* In addition, this is the point at which TCP switches from operating in slow start to operating in congestion avoidance.

The switch point is determined by the relationship between _cwnd_ and a value called the *_slow start threshold_* (or _ssthresh_).

.Operation of the classic slow start algorithm. In the simple case where ACKs are not delayed, every arriving good ACK allows the sender to inject two new packets (left). This leads to an exponential growth in the size of the senderâ€™s window as a function of time (right, upper line). When ACKs are delayed, such as when an ACK is produced for every other packet, the growth is still exponential but slower (right, lower line).
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-congestion-control/classic-slow-start.png[Operation of the classic slow start algorithm,55%,55%]

=== Congestion Avoidance

To find additional capacity that may become available, but to not do so too aggressively, TCP implements the congestion avoidance algorithm.

Once _ssthresh_ is established and _cwnd_ is at least at this level, a TCP runs the congestion avoidance algorithm, which seeks additional capacity by increasing _cwnd_ by approximately one segment for each window's worth of data that is moved from sender to receiver successfully.

This provides a much slower growth rate than slow start: approximately linear in terms of time, as opposed to slow start's exponential growth.

More precisely, _cwnd_ is usually updated as follows for each received nonduplicate ACK:

[.text-center,subs="+quotes"]
----
_cwnd~t+1~_ = _cwnd~t~_ + SMSS * SMSS/_cwnd~t~_
----

Looking at this relationship briefly, assume _cwnd~0~_ = _k_*_SMSS_ bytes were sent into the network in _k_ segments. After the first ACK arrives, _cwnd_ is updated to be larger by a factor of (1/_k_):

[.text-center,subs="+quotes"]
----
_cwnd~1~_ = _cwnd~0~_ + SMSS * SMSS/_cwnd~0~_

= _k_*SMSS + SMSS * (SMSS/(k*SMSS))

= _k_*SMSS + (1/_k_) * SMSS

= (_k_ + (1/_k_))*SMSS

= cwnd~0~ + (1/_k_)*SMSS
----

Because the value of _cwnd_ grows slightly with each new ACK arrival, and this value is in the denominator of the expression in the first equation above, the overall growth rate of _cwnd_ is slightly sublinear.

.Operation of the congestion avoidance algorithm. In the simple case where ACKs are not delayed, every arriving good ACK allows the sender to inject approximately _1/W_ fraction of a new packet. This leads to approximately linear growth in the size of the sender's window as a function of time (right, upper line). When ACKs are delayed, such as when an ACK is produced for every other packet, the growth is still approximately linear but somewhat slower (right, lower line).
image::/assets/tcp-ip/tcp-congestion-control/congestion-avoidance.png[Operation of the congestion avoidance algorithm,55%,55%]

The assumption of the algorithm is that packet loss caused by bit errors is very small (much less than 1%), and therefore the loss of a packet signals congestion somewhere in the network between the source and destination.

* If this assumption is false, which it sometimes is for wireless networks, TCP slows down even when no congestion is present.

* In addition, many RTTs may be required for the value of _cwnd_ to grow large, which is required for efficient use of networks with high capacity.

=== Selecting between Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance

In normal operations, a TCP connection is always running either the slow start or the congestion avoidance procedure, but never the two simultaneously.

* When _cwnd < ssthresh_, slow start is used, and when _cwnd > ssthresh_, congestion avoidance is used.
* When they are equal, either can be used.

The initial value of _ssthresh_ may be set arbitrarily high (e.g., to _awnd_ or higher), which causes TCP to always start with slow start. When a retransmission occurs, caused by either a retransmission timeout or the execution of fast retransmit, _ssthresh_ is updated as follows:

[.text-center,subs="+quotes"]
----
_ssthresh_ = max(_flight size_/2, 2*_SMSS_)
----

=== Tahoe, Reno, and Fast Recovery

The slow start and congestion avoidance constitute the first congestion control algorithms which were introduced in the late 1980s with the 4.2 release of UC Berkeley's version of UNIX, called the _Berkeley Software Distribution_, or _BSD UNIX_.

The 4.2 release of BSD (called _Tahoe_) included a version of TCP that started connections in slow start, and if a packet was lost, detected by either a timeout or the fast retransmit procedure, the slow start algorithm was reinitiated.

Tahoe was implemented by simply reducing _cwnd_ to its starting value (1 SMSS at that time) upon any loss, forcing the connection to slow start until _cwnd_ grew to the value _ssthresh_.

One problem with this approach is that for large BDP paths, this can cause the connection to significantly underutilize the available bandwidth while the sending TCP goes through slow start to get back to the point at which it was operating before the packet loss.

To address this problem, the reinitiation of slow start on any packet loss was reconsidered.

* Ultimately, if packet loss is detected by duplicate ACKs (invoking fast retransmit), _cwnd_ is instead reset to the last value of _ssthresh_ instead of only 1 SMSS.
* Slow start is still initiated on a timeout, which is generally the case for most TCP variants.
* This approach allows the TCP to slow down to half of its previous rate without reverting to slow start.

In exploring the issue of large BDP paths further and thinking back to the conservation of packets principle mentioned before, it has been observed that any ACKs that are received, even while recovering after a loss, still represent opportunities to inject new packets into the network.

* This became the basis of the *fast recovery* procedure, which was released in conjunction with the popular 4.3 BSD *Reno* version of BSD UNIX.

* Fast recovery allows _cwnd_ to (temporarily) grow by 1 SMSS for each ACK received while recovering.

* The congestion window is therefore _inflated_ for a period of time, allowing an additional new packet to be sent for each ACK received, until a good ACK is seen.  
* Any nonduplicate (_good_) ACK causes TCP to exit recovery and reduces the congestion back to its pre-inflated value.

TCP Reno became very popular and ultimately the basis for what might reasonably be called "standard TCP".

=== Standard TCP

To summarize the combined algorithm from <<RFC5681>>, TCP begins a connection in slow start (_cwnd_ = _IW_) with a large value of _ssthresh_, generally at least the value of _awnd_.

Upon receiving a good ACK (one that acknowledges new data), TCP updates the value of _cwnd_ as follows:

[.text-center,subs="+quotes"]
----
_cwnd_ += _SMSS_         (if _cwnd_ < _ssthresh_)        Slow start
_cwnd_ += _SMSS_*_SMSS_/_cwnd_         (if _cwnd_ > _ssthresh_)        Congestion avoidance
----

When fast retransmit is invoked because of receipt of a third duplicate ACK (or other signal, if conventional fast retransmit initiation is not used), the following actions are performed:

. _ssthresh_ is updated to no more than the value given in equation _ssthresh_ = max(_flight size_/2, 2*_SMSS_).

. The fast retransmit algorithm is performed, and _cwnd_ is set to (_ssthresh_ + 3*_SMSS_).

. _cwnd_ is temporarily increased by _SMSS_ for each duplicate ACK received.

. When a good ACK is received, _cwnd_ is reset back to _ssthresh_.

//-

* The actions in steps 2 and 3 constitute _fast recovery_.

* Step 2 first adjusts _cwnd_, which usually causes it to be reduced to half of its former value, and then temporarily inflates it to take into account the fact that the receipt of each duplicate ACK indicates that some packet has left the network (and thus should permit another to be inserted).
+
This step is also where _multiplicative decrease_ occurs, as _cwnd_ is ordinarily multiplied by some value (0.5 here) to form its new value.

* Step 3 continues the inflation process, allowing the sender to send additional packets (assuming _awnd_ is not exceeded).

* In step 4, the TCP is assumed to have recovered, so the temporary inflation is removed (and so this step is sometimes called _deflation_).

Slow start is always used in two cases: when a new connection is started, and when a retransmission timeout occurs.

* It can also be invoked when a sender has been idle for a relatively long time or there is some other reason to suspect that _cwnd_ may not accurately reflect the current network congestion state.
+
In this case, the initial value of _cwnd_ is set to the _restart window_ (_RW_).
+
In <<RFC5681>>, the recommended value of _RW_ = min(_IW_, _cwnd_).

* Other than this case, when slow start is invoked, _cwnd_ is set to _IW_.

== Evolution of the Standard Algorithms

The classic and standard TCP algorithms made a tremendous contribution to the operation of TCP, essentially addressing the major problem of Internet congestion collapse.

[NOTE]
====
The problem of Internet congestion collapse was a serious concern during the
years 1986â€“1988. In October 1986 the NSFNET backbone, an important component
of the early Internet, had been observed to operate with an effective capacity
some 1000 times less than it should have (called the "NSFNET meltdown").
The primary reason for the problem was aggressive retransmissions during times
of loss without any controls. This behavior drove the network into a persistently
congested state where packet loss was massive (causing more retransmissions)
and throughput was low. Adoption of the classic congestion control algorithms
effectively eliminated this problem.
====

=== NewReno

One problem with fast recovery is that when multiple packets are dropped in a window of data, once one packet is recovered (i.e., successfully delivered and ACKed), a good ACK can be received at the sender that causes the temporary window inflation in fast recovery to be erased before all the packets that were lost have been retransmitted.

NOTE: ACKs that trigger this behavior are called _partial ACKs_ (ACKs that cover previously unacknowledged data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected).

A Reno TCP reacting to a partial ACK by reducing its inflated congestion window can go idle until a retransmission timer fires.

* To understand why this happens, recall that (non-SACK) TCP depends on the signal of three (or _dupthresh_) duplicate ACKs to trigger its fast retransmit procedure.
* If there are not enough packets in the network, it is not possible to trigger this procedure on packet loss, ultimately leading to the expiration of the retransmission timer and invocation of the slow start procedure, which drastically impacts TCP throughput performance.

To address this problem with Reno, a modification called *_NewReno_* <<RFC3782>> has been developed.

* This procedure modifies fast recovery by keeping track of the highest sequence number from the last transmitted window of data (the _recovery point_).

* Only when an ACK with an ACK number at least as large as the recovery point is received is the inflation of fast recovery removed.

* This allows a TCP to continue sending one segment for each ACK it receives while recovering and reduces the occurrence of retransmission timeouts, especially when multiple packets are dropped in a single window of data.

NewReno is a popular variant of modern TCPsâ€”it does not suffer from the problems of the original fast recovery and is significantly less complicated to implement than SACKs.

With SACKs, however, a TCP can perform better than NewReno when multiple packets are lost in a window of data, but doing this requires careful attention to the congestion control procedures.

=== TCP Congestion Control with SACK

With SACK TCP, the sender can be informed of multiple missing segments and would theoretically be able to send them all immediately because they would all be in the valid window.

However, this might involve sending too much data into the network at once, thereby compromising the congestion control.

The following issue arises with SACK TCP: using only _cwnd_ as a bound on the sender's sliding window to indicate how many (and which) packets to send during recovery periods is not sufficient.

Instead, the selection of _which_ packets to send needs to be decoupled from the choice of _when_ to send them.

One way to implement this decoupling is to have a TCP keep track of how much data it has injected into the network separately from the maintenance of the window.

* In <<RFC3517>> this is called the _pipe_ variable, an estimate of the flight size.
+
Importantly, the _pipe_ variable counts bytes (or packets, depending on the implementation) of transmissions and retransmissions, provided they are not known to be lost.

* Assuming a large value of _awnd_, a SACK TCP is permitted to send a segment anytime the following relationship holds true: _cwnd_ - _pipe_ â‰¥ _SMSS_.
+
In other words, _cwnd_ is still used to place a limit on the amount of data that can be outstanding in the network, but the amount of data estimated to be in the network is accounted for separately from the window itself.
