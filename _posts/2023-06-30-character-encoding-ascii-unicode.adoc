== Character encoding

*Character encoding* is the process of assigning _numbers_ to _graphical characters_, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be _stored_, _transmitted_, and _transformed_ using digital computers.

The numerical values that make up a character encoding are known as {code_point}[_code points_] and collectively comprise a _code space_, a _{code_page}[code page]_, or a _character map_. <<1>>

=== Terminology related to character encoding

* A _character_ is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.

* A _character set_ is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages.
+
TIP: _Example_: The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.

* A _coded character set_ is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.

* A _code point_ of a coded character set is any allowed value in the character set or code space.

* A _code space_ is a range of integers whose values are code points.

* A _code unit_ is the "word size" of the character encoding scheme, such as 7-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit.
+
TIP: In some schemes, some characters are encoded using multiple code units, resulting in a variable-length encoding.

=== Character repertoire (the abstract set of characters)

The character repertoire (/Ààrep…ôtw…ëÀê(r)/) is an abstract set of more than one million characters found in a wide variety of scripts including Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Other symbols such as musical notation are also included in the character repertoire.

Both the {unicode}[Unicode] and {GB_18030}[GB 18030] standards have a character repertoire. As new characters are added to one standard, the other standard also adds those characters, to maintain parity.

The code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding:

* A code unit in {US-ASCII}[US-ASCII] consists of 7 bits;
* A code unit in {UTF-8}[UTF-8], {EBCDIC}[EBCDIC] and {GB_18030}[GB 18030] consists of 8 bits;
* A code unit in {UTF-16}[UTF-16] consists of 16 bits;
* A code unit in {UTF-32}[UTF-32] consists of 32 bits.

=== Glyphs, graphemes and characters

In most languages written in any variety of the _Latin alphabet_ except English, the use of _diacritics_ to signify a sound mutation is common. For example, the _grapheme_ ‚ü®√†‚ü© requires two _glyphs_: the basic `a` and the _grave accent_ ```. <<2>>

In computing as well as _typography_, the term "_character_" refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in natural language writing systems (_scripts_).

[TIP]
====
* In linguistics, a _grapheme_ is the smallest functional unit of a _writing system_. <<3>>
+
* A _glyph_ (/…°l…™f/) is any kind of purposeful mark.
+
* In typography, a glyph is "the specific shape, design, or representation of a character".
+
It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface, of an element of written language.
+
A grapheme, or part of a grapheme (such as a diacritic), or sometimes several graphemes in combination (a composed glyph) can be represented by a glyph.

=== Example of a code unit

Consider a string of the letters "abÃ≤cêêÄ", that is, a string containing a Unicode combining character (`U+0332` ``Ã≤ ``) as well a supplementary character (`U+1040` ``êêÄ``).

It has several representations which are logically equivalent, yet while each is suited to a diverse set of circumstances or range of requirements: 

* Four https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)[composed characters]:
+
`a`, `bÃ≤`, `c`, `êêÄ`

* Five link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme[graphemes]:
+
`a`, `b`, `_`, `c`, `êêÄ`

* Five Unicode {code_point}[code points]:
+
`U+0061`, `U+0062`, `U+0332`, `U+0063`, `U+10400`

* Five UTF-32 code units (32-bit integer values):
+
`0x00000061`, `0x00000062`, `0x00000332`, `0x00000063`, `0x00010400`

* Six UTF-16 code units (16-bit integers)
+
`0x0061`, `0x0062`, `0x0332`, `0x0063`, `0xd801`, `0xdc00`

* Nine UTF-8 code units (8-bit values, or {byte}[bytes])
+
`0x61`, `0x62`, `0xCC`, `0xB2`, `0x63`, `0xf0`, `0x90`, `0x90`, `0x80`

Note in particular the last character, which is represented with either one _1_ 32-bit value, _2_ 16-bit values. or _4_ 8-bit values. Although each of those forms uses the same total number of bits (32) to represent the glyph, the actual numeric byte values and their arrangement appear entirely unrelated. 

=== Code point

The convention to refer to a character in Unicode is to start with `U+` followed by the codepoint value in hexadecimal.

* The range of valid code points for the Unicode standard is `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`, inclusive, divided in 17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)[planes], identified by the numbers 0 to 16.

* Characters in the range `U+0000` to `U+FFFF` are in plane 0, called the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane[Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)].
+
This plane contains most commonly-used characters.

* Characters in the range `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF` in the other planes are called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_characters[supplementary characters].

_A code point is represented by a sequence of code units._ The mapping is defined by the encoding. Thus, the number of code units required to represent a code point depends on the encoding:

* *UTF-8*: code points map to a sequence of one, two, three or four code units.

* *UTF-16*: code units are twice as long as 8-bit code units.
+
Therefore, any code point with a scalar value less than `U+10000` is encoded with a single code unit.
+
Code points with a value `U+10000` or higher require two code units each.
+
These pairs of code units have a unique term in UTF-16: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Code_points_from_U+010000_to_U+10FFFF[Unicode surrogate pairs]".

* *UTF-32*: the 32-bit code unit is large enough that every code point is represented as a single code unit.

* *GB 18030*: multiple code units per code point are common, because of the small code units. Code points are mapped to one, two, or four code units.

=== Unicode encoding model

{Unicode}[Unicode] and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 {universal_character_set}[Universal Character Set], together constitute a modern, unified character encoding.

Rather than mapping characters directly to octets ({byte}[bytes]), they separately define what characters are available, corresponding natural numbers ({code_point}[code points]), how those numbers are encoded as a series of fixed-size natural numbers (_code units_), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets.

The purpose of this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.

To describe this model correctly requires more precise terms than "_character set_" and "_character encoding_." The terms used in the modern model follow:

A *character repertoire* is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports.

* The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the {windows_code_page}[Windows code pages]).

* The *characters* in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into basic information units.
+
The basic variants of the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets can be broken down into _letters_, _digits_, _punctuation_, and a few _special characters_ such as the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read.
+
But even with these alphabets, {diacritic}[diacritics] pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known as a precomposed character), or as separate characters.
+
The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text.

* A *coded character set (CCS)* is a function that maps characters to {code_point}[code points] (_each code point represents one character_).
+
For example, in a given repertoire, the capital letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be represented by the code point 65, the character "B" to 66, and so on.
+
Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example ISO/IEC 8859-1 and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different code points.

* A *character encoding form (CEF)* is the mapping of code points to code units to facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers as bit sequences of fixed length (i.e. practically any computer system).
+
For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units can only directly represent code points 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger code points (say, 65,536 to 1.4 million) could be represented by using multiple 16-bit units. This correspondence is defined by a CEF.

* Next, a *character encoding scheme (CES)* is the mapping of code units to a sequence of octets to facilitate storage on an octet-based file system or transmission over an octet-based network.
+
_Simple character encoding schemes_ include UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE, UTF-16LE or UTF-32LE; _compound character encoding schemes_, such as UTF-16, UTF-32 and ISO/IEC 2022, switch between several simple schemes by using a {byte_order_mark}[byte order mark] or {byte_order_mark}[escape sequences]; _compressing schemes_ try to minimize the number of bytes used per code unit (such as SCSU, BOCU, and Punycode).
+
[TIP]
====
The _byte order mark (BOM)_ is a particular usage of the special Unicode character, _U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE_, whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program reading the text:

* The _byte order_, or _endianness_, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 32-bit encodings;

* The fact that the text stream's encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence;

* Which Unicode character encoding is used.

====

The Unicode model uses the term character map for historical systems which directly assign a sequence of characters to a sequence of bytes, covering all of CCS, CEF and CES layers.
