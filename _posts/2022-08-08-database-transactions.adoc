== The Meaning of ACID

The safety guarantees provided by transactions are often described by the wellknown acronym *ACID*, which stands for *Atomicity*, *Consistency*, *Isolation*, and *Durability*.

It was coined in 1983 by Theo Härder and Andreas Reuter in an effort to establish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases.

However, in practice, one database’s implementation of ACID does not equal another’s implementation. For example, as we shall see, there is a lot of ambiguity around the meaning of isolation. The high-level idea is sound, but the devil is in the details. Today, when a system claims to be “*ACID compliant*,” it’s unclear what guarantees you can actually expect. ACID has unfortunately become mostly a marketing term.

(Systems that do not meet the ACID criteria are sometimes called *BASE*, which stands for *Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventual consistency*. This is even
more vague than the definition of ACID. It seems that the only sensible definition of BASE is “not ACID”; i.e., it can mean almost anything you want.)

=== Atomicity

In general, *atomic* refers to something that cannot be _broken down into smaller parts_. The word means similar but subtly different things in different branches of computing. For example, in multi-threaded programming, if one thread executes an atomic operation, that means there is no way that another thread could see the half-finished result of the operation. The system can only be in the state it was before the operation or after the operation, not something in between.

By contrast, in the context of ACID, *_atomicity is not about concurrency_*. It does not describe what happens if several processes try to access the same data at the sametime, because that is covered under the letter *I*, for isolation.

Rather, ACID atomicity describes what happens if a client wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed—for example, a process crashes, a network connection is interrupted, a disk becomes full, or some integrity constraint is violated. If the writes are grouped together into an atomic transaction, and the transaction cannot be completed (*_committed_*) due to a fault, then the transaction is *_aborted_* and the database must discard or undo any writes it has made so far in that transaction.

Without atomicity, if an error occurs partway through making multiple changes, it’s difficult to know which changes have taken effect and which haven’t. The application could try again, but that risks making the same change twice, leading to duplicate or incorrect data. Atomicity simplifies this problem: if a transaction was aborted, the application can be sure that it didn’t change anything, so it can safely be retried.

The ability to abort a transaction on error and have all writes from that transaction discarded is the defining feature of ACID atomicity. Perhaps *abortability* would have been a better term than atomicity, but we will stick with atomicity since that’s the usual word.

=== Consistency

The word consistency is terribly overloaded:

* We discussed *replica consistency* and the issue of *eventual consistency* that arises in asynchronously replicated systems.
* *Consistent hashing* is an approach to partitioning that some systems use for rebalancing.
* In the CAP theorem, the word consistency is used to mean *linearizability*.
* In the context of ACID, consistency refers to an application-specific notion of the database being in a “*good state*.”

It’s unfortunate that the same word is used with at least four different meanings.

The idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data (*invariants*) that must always be true—for example, in an accounting system, credits and debits across all accounts must always be balanced. If a transaction starts with a database that is valid according to these invariants, and any writes during the transaction preserve the validity, then you can be sure that the invariants are always satisfied.

However, this idea of *_consistency depends on the application’s notion of invariants, and it’s the application’s responsibility to define its transactions correctly so that they preserve consistency_*. This is not something that the database can guarantee: if you write bad data that violates your invariants, the database can’t stop you.

*Atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application*. The application may rely on the database’s atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency, but it’s not up to the database alone. Thus, the letter *C* doesn’t really belong in ACID.

=== Isolation

Most databases are accessed by several clients at the same time. That is no problem if they are reading and writing different parts of the database, but if they are accessing the same database records, you can run into concurrency problems (*_race conditions_*).

*Isolation* in the sense of ACID means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other: they cannot step on each other’s toes. The classic database textbooks formalize isolation as *serializability*, which means that _each transaction can pretend that it is the only transaction running on the entire database_. The database ensures that when the transactions have committed, the result is the same as if they had run serially (one after another), even though in reality they may have run concurrently. However, in practice, serializable isolation is rarely used, because it carries a performance penalty.

=== Durability

The purpose of a database system is to provide a safe place where data can be stored without fear of losing it. *Durability* is the promise that once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes.

In a *single-node database*, durability typically means that the data has been written to nonvolatile storage such as a hard drive or SSD. It usually also involves a *_write-ahead log_* or similar, which allows recovery in the event that the data structures on disk are corrupted. In a *replicated database*, durability may mean that the data has been successfully copied to some number of nodes. In order to provide a durability guarantee, a database must wait until these writes or replications are complete before reporting a transaction as successfully committed.

== Handling errors and aborts

A key feature of a transaction is that it can be aborted and safely retried if an error occurred. ACID databases are based on this philosophy: *_if the database is in danger of violating its guarantee of atomicity, isolation, or durability, it would rather abandon the transaction entirely than allow it to remain half-finished._*

To recap, in ACID, atomicity and isolation describe what the database should do if a client makes several writes within the same transaction:

* *Atomicity*
+
If an error occurs halfway through a sequence of writes, the transaction should be aborted, and the writes made up to that point should be discarded. In other words, the database saves you from having to worry about partial failure, by giving an all-or-nothing guarantee.

* *Isolation*
+
Concurrently running transactions shouldn’t interfere with each other. For example, if one transaction makes several writes, then another transaction should see either all or none of those writes, but not some subset.

Although *_retrying an aborted transaction_* is a simple and effective error handling mechanism, it isn’t perfect:

* If the transaction actually succeeded, but the network failed while the server tried to acknowledge the successful commit to the client (so the client thinks it failed), then retrying the transaction causes it to be performed twice—unless you have an additional application-level *_deduplication_* mechanism in place.

* If the error is due to *_overload_*, retrying the transaction will make the problem worse, not better. To avoid such feedback cycles, you can limit the number of
retries, use *_exponential backoff_*, and handle overload-related errors differently from other errors (if possible).

* It is only worth retrying after *_transient errors_* (for example due to deadlock, isolation violation, temporary network interruptions, and failover); after a permanent error (e.g., constraint violation) a retry would be pointless.

* If the transaction also has *_side effects_* outside of the database, those side effects may happen even if the transaction is aborted. For example, if you’re sending an email, you wouldn’t want to send the email again every time you retry the transaction. If you want to make sure that several different systems either commit or abort together, *_two-phase commit_* can help.

* If the *_client process fails_* while retrying, any data it was trying to write to the database is lost.

== Weak Isolation Levels

If two transactions don’t touch the same data, they can safely be run in parallel, because neither depends on the other. Concurrency issues (race conditions) only come into play *_when one transaction reads data that is concurrently modified by another transaction_*, or *_when two transactions try to simultaneously modify the same data_*.

Concurrency bugs are *_hard to find by testing_*, because such bugs are only triggered when you get unlucky with the *_timing_*. Such timing issues might occur very rarely, and are usually *_difficult to reproduce_*. Concurrency is also very *_difficult to reason about_*, especially in a large application where you don’t necessarily know which other pieces of code are accessing the database. Application development is difficult enough if you just have one user at a time; having many concurrent users makes it much harder still, because any piece of data could unexpectedly change at any time.

For that reason, databases have long tried to hide concurrency issues from application developers by providing *transaction isolation*. In theory, isolation should make your life easier by letting you pretend that no concurrency is happening: *serializable* isolation means that the database guarantees that transactions have the same effect as if they ran serially (i.e., one at a time, without any concurrency).

In practice, isolation is unfortunately not that simple. *_Serializable isolation has a performance cost, and many databases don’t want to pay that price_*. It’s therefore common for systems to use *_weaker levels of isolation_*, which protect against some concurrency issues, but not all. Those levels of isolation are much harder to understand, and they can lead to subtle bugs, but they are nevertheless used in practice.

=== Read Committed

The most basic level of transaction isolation is read committed.v It makes two guarantees:

* When reading from the database, you will *_only see data that has been committed_* (no *_dirty reads_*).

* When writing to the database, you will *_only overwrite data that has been committed_* (no *_dirty writes_*).

[NOTE]
====
> Some databases support an even weaker isolation level called *read uncommitted*. It prevents dirty writes, but does not prevent dirty reads.
====

==== No dirty reads

Imagine a transaction has written some data to the database, but the transaction has not yet committed or aborted. Can another transaction see that uncommitted data? If yes, that is called a *dirty read*.

Transactions running at the read committed isolation level must prevent dirty reads. This means that any writes by a transaction only become visible to others when that transaction commits (and then all of its writes become visible at once).

There are a few reasons why it’s useful to prevent dirty reads:

* If a transaction needs to update several objects, a dirty read means that another transaction may see some of the updates but not others. Seeing the database in a partially updated state is confusing to users and may cause other transactions to take incorrect decisions.

* If a transaction aborts, any writes it has made need to be rolled back. If the database allows dirty reads, that means a transaction may see data that is later rolled back—i.e., which is never actually committed to the database. Reasoning about the consequences quickly becomes mind-bending.

==== No dirty writes

What happens if two transactions concurrently try to update the same object in a database? We don’t know in which order the writes will happen, but we normally
assume that the later write overwrites the earlier write.

However, what happens if the earlier write is part of a transaction that has not yet committed, so the later write overwrites an uncommitted value? This is called a *dirty write*. Transactions running at the read committed isolation level must prevent dirty writes, usually by delaying the second write until the first write’s transaction has committed or aborted.

By preventing dirty writes, this isolation level avoids some kinds of concurrency problems:

* If transactions *_update multiple objects_*, dirty writes can lead to a bad outcome.

* However, read committed does not prevent the race condition between two counter increments. In this case, the second write happens after the first transaction has committed, so it’s not a dirty write. It’s still incorrect, but for a different reason.

==== Implementing read committed

Read committed is a very popular isolation level. It is the default setting in Oracle 11g, PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2012, MemSQL, and many other databases.

Most commonly, databases *_prevent dirty writes by using row-level locks_*: when a transaction wants to modify a particular object (row or document), it must first
acquire a lock on that object. It must then hold that lock until the transaction is committed or aborted. Only one transaction can hold the lock for any given object; if another transaction wants to write to the same object, it must wait until the first transaction is committed or aborted before it can acquire the lock and continue. This locking is done automatically by databases in read committed mode (or stronger isolation levels).

How do we prevent dirty reads? One option would be to use the same lock, and to require any transaction that wants to read an object to briefly acquire the lock and then release it again immediately after reading. This would ensure that a read couldn’t happen while an object has a dirty, uncommitted value (because during that time the lock would be held by the transaction that has made the write).

However, the approach of requiring read locks does not work well in practice, because one long-running write transaction can force many read-only transactions to
wait until the *_long-running transaction_* has completed. This harms the response time of *_read-only transactions_* and is bad for operability: a slowdown in one part of an application can have a knock-on effect in a completely different part of the application, due to waiting for locks.

For that reason, most databases prevent dirty reads using the approach illustrated in Figure 7-4: for every object that is written, the database remembers both the *_old committed value_* and the *_new value_* set by the transaction that currently holds the write lock. While the transaction is ongoing, any other transactions that read the object are simply given the old value. Only when the new value is committed do transactions switch over to reading the new value.

=== Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read

If you look superficially at read committed isolation, you could be forgiven for thinking that it does everything that a transaction needs to do: it _allows aborts_ (required for atomicity), it _prevents reading the incomplete results of transactions_, and it _prevents concurrent writes_ from getting intermingled. Indeed, those are useful features, and much stronger guarantees than you can get from a system that has no transactions.

However, there are still plenty of ways in which you can have concurrency bugs when using this isolation level.

image::/assets/database-transactions/Figure_7-6_Read_skew.png[,75%,75%]

*Read skew* (or *nonrepeatable read*) is considered acceptable under read committed isolation: the account balances that Alice saw were indeed committed at the time when she read them.

*Snapshot isolation* is the most common solution to this problem. The idea is that each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database—that is, the transaction sees all the data that was committed in the database at the start of the transaction. Even if the data is subsequently changed by another transaction, each transaction sees only the old data from that particular point in time.

Snapshot isolation is a boon for *_long-running, read-only queries_* such as backups and analytics. It is very hard to reason about the meaning of a query if the data on which it operates is changing at the same time as the query is executing. When a transaction can see a consistent snapshot of the database, frozen at a particular point in time, it is much easier to understand.

==== Implementing snapshot isolation

Like read committed isolation, implementations of snapshot isolation typically *use write locks to prevent dirty writes*, which means that a transaction that makes a write can block the progress of another transaction that writes to the same object. However, *reads do not require any locks*. From a performance point of view, a key principle of snapshot isolation is *_readers never block writers, and writers never block readers_*. This allows a database to handle long-running read queries on a consistent snapshot at the same time as processing writes normally, without any lock contention between the two.

To implement snapshot isolation, databases use a generalization of the mechanism we saw for preventing dirty reads in Figure 7-4. The database must potentially *keep several different committed versions of an object*, because various in-progress transactions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. Because it maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as *multiversion concurrency control* (*_MVCC_*).

*_If a database only needed to provide read committed isolation, but not snapshot isolation, it would be sufficient to keep two versions of an object: the committed version and the overwritten-but-not-yet-committed version._* However, storage engines that support snapshot isolation typically use MVCC for their read committed isolation level as well. A typical approach is that read committed uses a separate snapshot for each query, while snapshot isolation uses the same snapshot for an entire transaction.

image::/assets/database-transactions/Figure_7-7_snapshot_isolation_mvcc.png[,75%,75%]

==== Visibility rules for observing a consistent snapshot

When a transaction reads from the database, transaction IDs are used to decide which objects it can see and which are invisible. By carefully defining visibility rules, the database can present a consistent snapshot of the database to the application. This works as follows:

1. At the start of each transaction, the database makes a list of all the other transactions that are in progress (not yet committed or aborted) at that time. Any writes that those transactions have made are ignored, even if the transactions subsequently commit.
2. Any writes made by aborted transactions are ignored.
3. Any writes made by transactions with a later transaction ID (i.e., which started after the current transaction started) are ignored, regardless of whether those transactions have committed.
4. All other writes are visible to the application’s queries.

Put another way, an object is visible if both of the following conditions are true:

* At the time when the reader’s transaction started, the transaction that created the object had already committed.
* The object is not marked for deletion, or if it is, the transaction that requested deletion had not yet committed at the time when the reader’s transaction started.

==== Indexes and snapshot isolation

How do indexes work in a multi-version database? One option is to have the index simply point to all versions of an object and require an index query to filter out any object versions that are not visible to the current transaction. When *_garbage collection_* removes old object versions that are no longer visible to any transaction, the corresponding index entries can also be removed.

==== Repeatable read and naming confusion

Snapshot isolation is a useful isolation level, especially for read-only transactions. However, many databases that implement it call it by different names. In Oracle it is called serializable, and in PostgreSQL and MySQL it is called repeatable read.

The reason for this naming confusion is that the SQL standard doesn’t have the concept of snapshot isolation, because the standard is based on System R’s 1975 definition of isolation levels and snapshot isolation hadn’t yet been invented then. Instead, it defines repeatable read, which looks superficially similar to snapshot isolation. PostgreSQL and MySQL call their snapshot isolation level repeatable read because it meets the requirements of the standard, and so they can claim standards compliance.

Unfortunately, the SQL standard’s definition of isolation levels is flawed—it is ambiguous, imprecise, and not as implementation-independent as a standard should be. Even though several databases implement repeatable read, there are big differences in the guarantees they actually provide, despite being ostensibly standardized. There has been a formal definition of repeatable read in the research literature, but most implementations don’t satisfy that formal definition. And to top it
off, IBM DB2 uses “repeatable read” to refer to serializability

As a result, *_nobody really knows what repeatable read means._*

=== Preventing Lost Updates

The *_read committed_* and *_snapshot isolation_* levels we’ve discussed so far have been primarily about the guarantees of what a read-only transaction can see in the presence of concurrent writes. We have mostly ignored the issue of two transactions writing concurrently—we have only discussed dirty writes, one particular type of write-write conflict that can occur.

There are several other interesting kinds of conflicts that can occur between concurrently writing transactions. The best known of these is the *lost update* problem, e.g. the example of two concurrent counter increments.

The lost update problem can occur if an application reads some value from the database, modifies it, and writes back the modified value (a *_read-modify-write cycle_*). If two transactions do this concurrently, one of the modifications can be lost, because the second write does not include the first modification. (We sometimes say that the later write clobbers the earlier write.) This pattern occurs in various different scenarios:

* Incrementing a counter or updating an account balance (requires reading the current value, calculating the new value, and writing back the updated value)

* Making a local change to a complex value, e.g., adding an element to a list within a JSON document (requires parsing the document, making the change, and writing back the modified document).

* Two users editing a wiki page at the same time, where each user saves their changes by sending the entire page contents to the server, overwriting whatever is currently in the database

Because this is such a common problem, a variety of solutions have been developed.

==== Atomic write operations

Many databases provide atomic update operations, which remove the need to implement read-modify-write cycles in application code. They are usually the best solution if your code can be expressed in terms of those operations. For example, the following instruction is concurrency-safe in most relational databases:

[source,sql[]
----
UPDATE counters SET value = value + 1 WHERE key = 'foo';
----

Similarly, document databases such as MongoDB provide atomic operations for making local modifications to a part of a JSON document, and Redis provides atomic operations for modifying data structures such as priority queues. Not all writes can easily be expressed in terms of atomic operations—for example, updates to a wiki page involve arbitrary text editing—but in situations where atomic operations can be used, they are usually the best choice.

Atomic operations are usually implemented by taking an *exclusive lock* on the object when it is read so that no other transaction can read it until the update has been applied. This technique is sometimes known as cursor stability. Another option is to simply force all atomic operations to be executed on a *single thread*.

==== Explicit locking

Another option for preventing lost updates, if the database’s built-in atomic operations don’t provide the necessary functionality, is for the application to explicitly lock objects that are going to be updated. Then the application can perform a read-modify-write cycle, and if any other transaction tries to concurrently read the same object, it is forced to wait until the first read-modify-write cycle has completed.

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM figures
WHERE name = 'robot' AND game_id = 222
FOR UPDATE; <1>

-- Check whether move is valid, then update the position
-- of the piece that was returned by the previous SELECT.
UPDATE figures SET position = 'c4' WHERE id = 1234;

COMMIT;
----

<1> The `FOR UPDATE` clause indicates that the database should take a lock on all rows returned by this query.

==== Automatically detecting lost updates

Atomic operations and locks are ways of preventing lost updates by forcing the read-modify- write cycles to happen sequentially. An alternative is to allow them to execute in parallel and, if the transaction manager detects a lost update, abort the transaction and force it to retry its read-modify-write cycle.

An advantage of this approach is that databases can perform this check efficiently in conjunction with snapshot isolation. Indeed, PostgreSQL’s repeatable read, Oracle’s serializable, and SQL Server’s snapshot isolation levels automatically detect when a lost update has occurred and abort the offending transaction. However, MySQL/InnoDB’s repeatable read does not detect lost updates. Some authors argue that a database must prevent lost updates in order to qualify as providing snapshot isolation, so MySQL does not provide snapshot isolation under this definition.

Lost update detection is a great feature, because it doesn’t require application code to use any special database features—you may forget to use a lock or an atomic operation and thus introduce a bug, but lost update detection happens automatically and is thus less error-prone.

==== Compare-and-set

In databases that don’t provide transactions, you sometimes find an atomic *compare-and-set* operation. The purpose of this operation is to avoid lost updates by allowing an update to happen only if the value has not changed since you last read it. If the current value does not match what you previously read, the update has no effect, and the read-modify-write cycle must be retried.

For example, to prevent two users concurrently updating the same wiki page, you might try something like this, expecting the update to occur only if the content of the page hasn’t changed since the user started editing it:

[source,sql]
----
-- This may or may not be safe, depending on the database implementation
UPDATE wiki_pages SET content = 'new content'
WHERE id = 1234 AND content = 'old content';
----

If the content has changed and no longer matches `'old content'`, this update will have no effect, so you need to check whether the update took effect and retry if necessary. _However, if the database allows the `WHERE` clause to read from an old snapshot, this statement may not prevent lost updates, because the condition may be true even though another concurrent write is occurring_. Check whether your database’s compare-and-set operation is safe before relying on it.

==== Conflict resolution and replication

In *replicated databases*, preventing lost updates takes on another dimension: since they have copies of the data on multiple nodes, and the data can potentially be modified concurrently on different nodes, some additional steps need to be taken to prevent lost updates.

Locks and compare-and-set operations assume that there is a *_single up-to-date copy of the data_*. However, databases with multi-leader or leaderless replication usually allow several writes to happen concurrently and replicate them asynchronously, so they cannot guarantee that there is a single up-to-date copy of the data. Thus, techniques based on locks or compare-and-set do not apply in this context.

Instead, a common approach in such replicated databases is to allow concurrent writes to create several conflicting versions of a value (also known as *_siblings_*), and to use application code or special data structures to resolve and merge these versions after the fact.

Atomic operations can work well in a replicated context, especially if they are commutative (i.e., you can apply them in a different order on different replicas, and still get the same result). For example, incrementing a counter or adding an element to a set are commutative operations. That is the idea behind Riak 2.0 datatypes, which prevent lost updates across replicas. When a value is concurrently updated by different clients, Riak automatically merges together the updates in such a way that no updates are lost.

On the other hand, the *_last write wins_* (LWW) conflict resolution method is prone to lost updates. Unfortunately, LWW is the default in many replicated databases.

=== Write Skew and Phantoms

In the previous sections we saw *dirty writes* and *lost updates*, two kinds of race conditions that can occur when different transactions concurrently try to write to the same objects. In order to avoid data corruption, those race conditions need to be prevented—either automatically by the database, or by manual safeguards such as using locks or atomic write operations.

image::/assets/database-transactions/Figure_7-8_example_of_write_skew.png[,75%,75%]

In each transaction, your application first checks that two or more doctors are currently on call; if yes, it assumes it’s safe for one doctor to go off call. Since the database is using snapshot isolation, both checks return 2, so both transactions proceed to the next stage. Alice updates her own record to take herself off call, and Bob updates his own record likewise. Both transactions commit, and now no doctor is on call. *_Your requirement of having at least one doctor on call has been violated._*

==== Characterizing write skew

This anomaly is called *write skew*. It is neither a dirty write nor a lost update, because the two transactions are updating two different objects (Alice’s and Bob’s oncall records, respectively). It is less obvious that a conflict occurred here, but it’s definitely a *_race condition_*: if the two transactions had run one after another, the second doctor would have been prevented from going off call. The anomalous behavior was only possible because the transactions ran concurrently.

You can think of *_write skew as a generalization of the lost update problem_*. Write skew can occur if *_two transactions read the same objects, and then update some of those objects_* (different transactions may update different objects). In the special case where different transactions update the same object, you get a dirty write or lost update anomaly (depending on the timing).

If you can’t use a *_serializable isolation level_*, the second-best option in this case is probably to *_explicitly lock_* the rows that the transaction depends on. In the doctors example, you could write something like the following:

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM doctors
WHERE on_call = true
AND shift_id = 1234 FOR UPDATE; <1>

UPDATE doctors
SET on_call = false
WHERE name = 'Alice'
AND shift_id = 1234;

COMMIT;
----

<1> As before, `FOR UPDATE` tells the database to lock all rows returned by this query.

==== Phantoms causing write skew

All of these examples follow a similar pattern:
1. A `SELECT` query checks whether some requirement is satisfied by searching for rows that match some search condition (there are at least two doctors on call, there are no existing bookings for that room at that time, the position on the board doesn’t already have another figure on it, the username isn’t already taken, there is still money in the account).

2. Depending on the result of the first query, the application code decides how to continue (perhaps to go ahead with the operation, or perhaps to report an error to the user and abort).

3. If the application decides to go ahead, it makes a write (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) to the database and commits the transaction. The effect of this write changes the precondition of the decision of step 2. In other words, if you were to repeat the `SELECT` query from step 1 after commiting the write, you would get a different result, because the write changed the set of rows matching the search condition (there is now one fewer doctor on call, the meeting room is now booked for that time, the position on the board is now taken by the figure that was moved, the username is now taken, there is now less money in the account).

The steps may occur in a different order. For example, you could first make the write, then the `SELECT` query, and finally decide whether to abort or commit based on the result of the query.

In the case of the doctor on call example, the row being modified in step 3 was one of the rows returned in step 1, so we could make the transaction safe and _avoid write skew by locking the rows_ in step 1 (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`). However, the other four examples are different: they check for the *_absence_* of rows matching some search condition, and the write adds a row matching the same condition. If the query in step 1 doesn’t return any rows, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` can’t attach locks to anything.

This effect, where a write in one transaction changes the result of a search query in another transaction, is called a *phantom*. Snapshot isolation avoids phantoms in read-only queries, but in read-write transactions like the examples we discussed, phantoms can lead to particularly tricky cases of write skew.

=== Materializing conflicts

If the problem of phantoms is that there is no object to which we can attach the locks, perhaps we can artificially introduce a lock object into the database?

For example, in the meeting room booking case you could imagine creating a table of time slots and rooms. Each row in this table corresponds to a particular room for a particular time period (say, 15 minutes). You create rows for all possible combinations of rooms and time periods ahead of time, e.g. for the next six months.

Now a transaction that wants to create a booking can lock (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`) the rows in the table that correspond to the desired room and time period. After it has acquired the locks, it can check for overlapping bookings and insert a new booking as before. Note that the additional table isn’t used to store information about the booking—it’s purely a collection of locks which is used to prevent bookings on the same room and time range from being modified concurrently.

This approach is called *materializing conflicts*, because it takes a phantom and turns it into a lock conflict on a concrete set of rows that exist in the database. Unfortunately, it can be hard and error-prone to figure out how to materialize conflicts, and it’s ugly to let a concurrency control mechanism leak into the application data model. For those reasons, materializing conflicts should be considered a last resort if no alternative is possible. A *serializable isolation* level is much preferable in most cases.

== Serializability

In this chapter we have seen several examples of transactions that are prone to race conditions. Some race conditions are prevented by the *_read committed_* and *_snapshot isolation_* levels, but others are not. We encountered some particularly tricky examples with *_write skew_* and *_phantoms_*. It’s a sad situation:

* Isolation levels are hard to understand, and inconsistently implemented in different databases (e.g., the meaning of “repeatable read” varies significantly).

* If you look at your application code, it’s difficult to tell whether it is safe to run at a particular isolation level—especially in a large application, where you might not be aware of all the things that may be happening concurrently.

* There are no good tools to help us detect race conditions. In principle, static analysis may help, but research techniques have not yet found their way into practical use. Testing for concurrency issues is hard, because they are usually nondeterministic—problems only occur if you get unlucky with the timing.

This is not a new problem—it has been like this since the 1970s, when weak isolation levels were first introduced. All along, the answer from researchers has been simple: use *serializable isolation*!

*_Serializable isolation is usually regarded as the strongest isolation level_*. It guarantees that even though transactions may execute in parallel, the end result is the same as if they had executed one at a time, serially, without any concurrency. Thus, the database guarantees that if the transactions behave correctly when run individually, they continue to be correct when run concurrently—in other words, the database prevents all possible race conditions.

But if serializable isolation is so much better than the mess of weak isolation levels, then why isn’t everyone using it? To answer this question, we need to look at the options for implementing serializability, and how they perform. Most databases that provide serializability today use one of three techniques, which we will explore in the rest of this chapter:

* Literally executing transactions in a serial order (actual serial execution)

* Two-phase locking (2PL), which for several decades was the only viable option

* Optimistic concurrency control techniques such as serializable snapshot isolation (SSI)

=== Actual Serial Execution

The simplest way of avoiding concurrency problems is to remove the concurrency entirely: *_to execute only one transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread_*. By doing so, we completely sidestep the problem of detecting and preventing conflicts between transactions: the resulting isolation is by definition serializable.

Even though this seems like an obvious idea, database designers only fairly recently—around 2007—decided that a single-threaded loop for executing transactions was feasible. If multi-threaded concurrency was considered essential for getting good performance during the previous 30 years, what changed to make single-threaded
execution possible?

Two developments caused this rethink:

* RAM became cheap enough that for many use cases is now feasible to keep the entire active dataset in memory. When all data that a transaction needs to access is in memory, transactions can execute much faster than if they have to wait for data to be loaded from disk.

* Database designers realized that OLTP transactions are usually short and only make a small number of reads and writes. By contrast, long-running analytic queries are typically readonly, so they can be run on a consistent snapshot (using snapshot isolation) outside of the serial execution loop.

The approach of executing transactions serially is implemented in VoltDB/H-Store, Redis, and Datomic. A system designed for single-threaded execution can sometimes perform better than a system that supports concurrency, because it can avoid the coordination overhead of locking. However, its throughput is limited to that of a single CPU core. In order to make the most of that single thread, transactions need to be structured differently from their traditional form.

==== Encapsulating transactions in stored procedures

In the early days of databases, the intention was that a database transaction could encompass an entire flow of user activity. For example, booking an airline ticket is a *_multi-stage process_* (searching for routes, fares, and available seats; deciding on an itinerary; booking seats on each of the flights of the itinerary; entering passenger details; making payment). Database designers thought that it would be neat if that entire process was one transaction so that it could be committed atomically.

Unfortunately, *_humans are very slow to make up their minds and respond_*. If a database transaction needs to wait for input from a user, the database needs to support a potentially huge number of concurrent transactions, most of them idle. Most databases cannot do that efficiently, and so almost all OLTP applications keep transactions short by avoiding interactively waiting for a user within a transaction. On the web, this means that a transaction is committed within the same HTTP request—a transaction does not span multiple requests. A new HTTP request starts a new transaction.

Even though the human has been taken out of the critical path, transactions have continued to be executed in an interactive client/server style, one statement at a time.

An application makes a query, reads the result, perhaps makes another query depending on the result of the first query, and so on. The queries and results are sent
back and forth between the application code (running on one machine) and the database server (on another machine).

In this *_interactive style of transaction_*, a lot of time is spent in network communication between the application and the database. If you were to disallow concurrency in the database and only process one transaction at a time, the throughput would be dreadful because the database would spend most of its time waiting for the application to issue the next query for the current transaction. In this kind of database, it’s necessary to process multiple transactions concurrently in order to get reasonable performance.

For this reason, systems with *_single-threaded serial transaction processing_* don’t allow *_interactive multi-statement transactions_*. Instead, the application must submit the entire transaction code to the database ahead of time, as a *_stored procedure_*. The differences between these approaches is illustrated in Figure 7-9. Provided that all data required by a transaction is in memory, the stored procedure can execute very fast, without waiting for any network or disk I/O.

==== Pros and cons of stored procedures

Stored procedures have existed for some time in relational databases, and they have been part of the SQL standard (SQL/PSM) since 1999. They have gained a somewhat
bad reputation, for various reasons:

* Each database vendor has its own language for stored procedures (Oracle has PL/SQL, SQL Server has T-SQL, PostgreSQL has PL/pgSQL, etc.). These languages haven’t kept up with developments in general-purpose programming languages, so they look quite ugly and archaic from today’s point of view, and they lack the ecosystem of libraries that you find with most programming languages.

* Code running in a database is difficult to manage: compared to an application server, it’s harder to debug, more awkward to keep in version control and deploy, trickier to test, and difficult to integrate with a metrics collection system for monitoring.

* A database is often much more performance-sensitive than an application server, because a single database instance is often shared by many application servers. A badly written stored procedure (e.g., using a lot of memory or CPU time) in a database can cause much more trouble than equivalent badly written code in an
application server.

However, those issues can be overcome. Modern implementations of stored procedures have abandoned PL/SQL and use existing general-purpose programming languages instead: VoltDB uses Java or Groovy, Datomic uses Java or Clojure, and Redis uses Lua.

With stored procedures and in-memory data, executing all transactions on a single thread becomes feasible. As they don’t need to wait for I/O and they avoid the overhead of other concurrency control mechanisms, they can achieve quite good throughput on a single thread.

VoltDB also uses stored procedures for replication: instead of copying a transaction’s writes from one node to another, it executes the same stored procedure on each replica. VoltDB therefore requires that stored procedures are deterministic (when run on different nodes, they must produce the same result). If a transaction needs to use the current date and time, for example, it must do so through special deterministic APIs.

==== Partitioning

Executing all transactions serially makes concurrency control much simpler, but limits the transaction throughput of the database to the speed of *_a single CPU core on a single machine_*. Read-only transactions may execute elsewhere, using snapshot isolation, but for applications with high write throughput, the single-threaded transaction processor can become a serious bottleneck.

In order to scale to multiple CPU cores, and multiple nodes, you can potentially partition your data, which is supported in VoltDB. If you can find a way of partitioning your dataset so that each transaction only needs to *_read and write data within a single partition_*, then each partition can have its own transaction processing thread running independently from the others. In this case, you can give each CPU core its own partition, which allows your transaction throughput to scale linearly with the number of CPU cores.

However, for any transaction that needs to access multiple partitions, the database must coordinate the transaction across all the partitions that it touches. The stored procedure needs to be performed in lock-step across all partitions to ensure serializability across the whole system.

Since *_cross-partition transactions_* have additional coordination overhead, they are vastly slower than single-partition transactions. VoltDB reports a throughput of about 1,000 cross-partition writes per second, which is orders of magnitude below its single-partition throughput and cannot be increased by adding more machines. Whether transactions can be single-partition depends very much on the structure of the data used by the application. Simple key-value data can often be partitioned very easily, but data with multiple secondary indexes is likely to require a lot of *_cross-partition coordination_*.

==== Summary of serial execution

Serial execution of transactions has become a viable way of achieving serializable isolation within certain constraints:

* Every transaction must be small and fast, because it takes only one slow transaction to stall all transaction processing.
* It is limited to use cases where the active dataset can fit in memory. Rarely accessed data could potentially be moved to disk, but if it needed to be accessed in a single-threaded transaction, the system would get very slow.

[NOTE]
====
If a transaction needs to access data that’s not in memory, the best solution may be to abort the transaction, asynchronously fetch the data into memory while continuing to process other transactions, and then restart the transaction when the data has been loaded. This approach is known as *_anti-caching_*.
====

* Write throughput must be low enough to be handled on a single CPU core, or else transactions need to be partitioned without requiring cross-partition coordination.

* Cross-partition transactions are possible, but there is a hard limit to the extent to which they can be used.

=== Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

For around 30 years, there was only one widely used algorithm for serializability in databases: *two-phase locking* (2PL).

.2PL is not 2PC
[NOTE]
====
Note that while two-phase locking (2PL) sounds very similar to *two-phase commit* (2PC), they are completely different things.
====

We saw previously that locks are often used to prevent dirty writes: if two transactions concurrently try to write to the same object, the lock ensures that the second writer must wait until the first one has finished its transaction (aborted or committed) before it may continue.

Two-phase locking is similar, but makes the lock requirements much stronger. Several transactions are allowed to concurrently read the same object as long as nobody
is writing to it. But as soon as anyone wants to write (modify or delete) an object, exclusive access is required:

* If transaction A has read an object and transaction B wants to write to that object, B must wait until A commits or aborts before it can continue. (This ensures that B can’t change the object unexpectedly behind A’s back.)

* If transaction A has written an object and transaction B wants to read that object, B must wait until A commits or aborts before it can continue. (Reading an old
version of the object is not acceptable under 2PL.)

*_In 2PL, writers don’t just block other writers; they also block readers and vice versa._* Snapshot isolation has the mantra readers never block writers, and writers never block readers, which captures this key difference between snapshot isolation and two-phase locking. On the other hand, because 2PL provides serializability, it protects against all the race conditions discussed earlier, including lost updates and write skew.

==== Implementation of two-phase locking

2PL is used by the serializable isolation level in MySQL (InnoDB) and SQL Server, and the repeatable read isolation level in DB2.

The blocking of readers and writers is implemented by a having a lock on each object in the database. The lock can either be in *_shared mode_* or in *_exclusive mode_*. The lock is used as follows:

* If a transaction wants to read an object, it must first acquire the lock in shared mode. Several transactions are allowed to hold the lock in shared mode simultaneously, but if another transaction already has an exclusive lock on the object, these transactions must wait.

* If a transaction wants to write to an object, it must first acquire the lock in exclusive mode. No other transaction may hold the lock at the same time (either in
shared or in exclusive mode), so if there is any existing lock on the object, the transaction must wait.

* If a transaction first reads and then writes an object, it may *_upgrade its shared lock to an exclusive lock_*. The upgrade works the same as getting an exclusive lock directly.

* After a transaction has acquired the lock, it must continue to hold the lock until the end of the transaction (commit or abort). This is where the name “twophase”comes from: *_the first phase_* (while the transaction is executing) is when the locks are acquired, and *_the second phase_* (at the end of the transaction) is when all the locks are released.

Since so many locks are in use, it can happen quite easily that transaction A is stuck waiting for transaction B to release its lock, and vice versa. This situation is called *_deadlock_*. The database automatically detects deadlocks between transactions and aborts one of them so that the others can make progress. The aborted transaction needs to be retried by the application.

==== Performance of two-phase locking

The big downside of two-phase locking, and the reason why it hasn’t been used by everybody since the 1970s, is performance: transaction throughput and response times of queries are significantly worse under two-phase locking than under weak isolation.

This is partly due to the overhead of acquiring and releasing all those locks, but more importantly due to reduced concurrency. By design, if two concurrent transactions try to do anything that may in any way result in a race condition, one has to wait for the other to complete.

Traditional relational databases don’t limit the duration of a transaction, because they are designed for interactive applications that *_wait_* for human input. Consequently, when one transaction has to wait on another, there is no limit on how long it may have to wait. Even if you make sure that you keep all your transactions short, a queue may form if several transactions want to access the same object, so a transaction may have to *_wait_* for several others to complete before it can do anything.

For this reason, databases running 2PL can have quite *_unstable latencies_*, and they can be very *_slow at high percentiles_* if there is contention in the workload. It may take just one *_slow transaction_*, or one transaction that accesses a lot of data and *_acquires many locks_*, to cause the rest of the system to grind to a halt. This instability is problematic when robust operation is required.

Although *_deadlocks_* can happen with the lock-based read committed isolation level, they occur much more frequently under 2PL serializable isolation (depending on the access patterns of your transaction). This can be an additional performance problem: when a transaction is aborted due to deadlock and is retried, it needs to do its work all over again. If deadlocks are frequent, this can mean significant wasted effort.

==== Predicate locks

In the preceding description of locks, we glossed over a subtle but important detail. In “Phantoms causing write skew” we discussed the problem of phantoms—that is, one transaction changing the results of another transaction’s search query. A database with serializable isolation must prevent phantoms.

In the meeting room booking example this means that if one transaction has
searched for existing bookings for a room within a certain time window (see
Example 7-2), another transaction is not allowed to concurrently insert or update
another booking for the same room and time range. (It’s okay to concurrently insert
bookings for other rooms, or for the same room at a different time that doesn’t affect
the proposed booking.)
How do we implement this? 

Conceptually, a *predicate lock* works similarly to the *_shared/exclusive lock_* described earlier, but rather than belonging to a particular object (e.g., one row in a table), it belongs to all objects that *_match some search condition_*, such as:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE room_id = 123 AND
end_time > '2018-01-01 12:00' AND
start_time < '2018-01-01 13:00';
----

A predicate lock restricts access as follows:

* If transaction A wants to read objects matching some condition, like in that `SELECT` query, it must acquire a shared-mode predicate lock on the conditions of the query. If another transaction B currently has an exclusive lock on any object matching those conditions, A must wait until B releases its lock before it is allowed to make its query.

* If transaction A wants to insert, update, or delete any object, it must first check whether either the old or the new value matches any existing predicate lock. If there is a matching predicate lock held by transaction B, then A must wait until B has committed or aborted before it can continue.

The key idea here is that *_a predicate lock applies even to objects that do not yet exist_* in the database, but which might be added in the future (phantoms). If two-phase locking includes predicate locks, the database prevents all forms of write skew and other race conditions, and so its isolation becomes serializable.

==== Index-range locks

Unfortunately, predicate locks do not perform well: if there are many locks by active transactions, checking for matching locks becomes time-consuming. For that reason, most databases with 2PL actually implement *_index-range locking_* (also known as *_next key locking_*), which is a simplified approximation of predicate locking.

It’s safe to simplify a predicate by making it match a greater set of objects.

This provides effective protection against phantoms and write skew. Index-range locks are not as precise as predicate locks would be (they may lock a bigger range of objects than is strictly necessary to maintain serializability), but since they have much lower overheads, they are a good compromise.

If there is no suitable index where a range lock can be attached, the database can *_fall back to a shared lock on the entire table_*. This will not be good for performance, since it will stop all other transactions writing to the table, but it’s a safe fallback position.

=== Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)

This chapter has painted a bleak picture of concurrency control in databases. On the one hand, we have implementations of *_serializability that don’t perform well (two-phase locking) or don’t scale well (serial execution)_*. On the other hand, we have *_weak isolation levels that have good performance, but are prone to various race conditions (lost updates, write skew, phantoms, etc.)_*. Are serializable isolation and good performance fundamentally at odds with each other?

Perhaps not: an algorithm called *serializable snapshot isolation* (SSI) is very promising. It provides full serializability, but has only a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation. SSI is fairly new: it was first described in 2008 and is the subject of Michael Cahill’s PhD thesis.

Today SSI is used both in single-node databases (the serializable isolation level in PostgreSQL since version 9.1) and distributed databases (FoundationDB uses a similar algorithm). As SSI is so young compared to other concurrency control mechanisms, it is still proving its performance in practice, but it has the possibility of being fast enough to become the new default in the future.

==== Pessimistic versus optimistic concurrency control

Two-phase locking is a so-called *_pessimistic concurrency control_* mechanism: it is based on the principle that if anything might possibly go wrong (as indicated by a lock held by another transaction), it’s better to wait until the situation is safe again before doing anything. It is like *_mutual exclusion_*, which is used to protect data structures in multi-threaded programming.

Serial execution is, in a sense, *_pessimistic to the extreme_*: it is essentially equivalent to each transaction having an exclusive lock on the entire database (or one partition of the database) for the duration of the transaction. We compensate for the pessimism by making each transaction very fast to execute, so it only needs to hold the “lock” for a short time.

By contrast, *_serializable snapshot isolation_* is an *_optimistic concurrency control_* technique. Optimistic in this context means that instead of blocking if something potentially dangerous happens, transactions continue anyway, in the hope that everything will turn out all right. When a transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether anything bad happened (i.e., whether isolation was violated); if so, the trans action is aborted and has to be retried. Only transactions that executed serializably are allowed to commit.

Optimistic concurrency control is an old idea, and its advantages and disadvantages have been debated for a long time [53]. It performs badly if there is high contention (many transactions trying to access the same objects), as this leads to a high proportion of transactions needing to abort. If the system is already close to its maximum throughput, the additional transaction load from retried transactions can make performance worse.

However, if there is enough spare capacity, and if contention between transactions is not too high, optimistic concurrency control techniques tend to perform better than pessimistic ones. Contention can be reduced with commutative atomic operations: for example, if several transactions concurrently want to increment a counter, it doesn’t matter in which order the increments are applied (as long as the counter isn’t read in the same transaction), so the concurrent increments can all be applied without conflicting.

As the name suggests, *_SSI is based on snapshot isolation—that is, all reads within a transaction are made from a consistent snapshot of the database_*. This is the main difference compared to earlier optimistic concurrency control techniques. *_On top of snapshot isolation, SSI adds an algorithm for detecting serialization conflicts among writes and determining which transactions to abort._*
