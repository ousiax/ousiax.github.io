== Same-Origin Policy

The *same-origin policy* is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one {origin}[origin] can interact with a resource from another origin.

It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors. For example, it prevents a malicious website on the Internet from running JS in a browser to read data from a third-party webmail service (which the user is signed into) or a company intranet (which is protected from direct access by the attacker by not having a public IP address) and relaying that data to the attacker.

Two URLs have the same origin if the {protocol}[protocol], {port}[port] (if specified), and {host}[host] are the same for both. You may see this referenced as the "scheme/host/port tuple", or just "tuple". (A "tuple" is a set of items that together comprise a whole â€” a generic form for double/triple/quadruple/quintuple/etc.)

The following table gives examples of origin comparisons with the URL `#http://store.company.com#/dir/page.html`:

[cols="4,1,2",frame="ends",options="header",halign="left"]
|===
|URL|Outcome|Reason

|pass:[http]://store.company.com/dir2/other.html
|Same origin
|Only the path differs

|pass:[http]://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html
|Same origin
|Only the path differs

|#pass:[https]#://store.company.com/page.html
|Failure
|Different protocol

|pass:[http]://store.company.com:##81##/dir/page.html
|Failure
|Different port (http:// is port 80 by default)

|pass:[http]://#news.company.com#/dir/page.html
|Failure
|Different host
|===

== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ({cors}[CORS]) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any {origin}[origin]s (*domain*, *scheme*, or *port*) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from `https://domain-a.com` uses {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] to make a request for `https://domain-b.com/data.json`.

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] and the {fetch-api}[Fetch API] follow the {same-origin-policy}[same-origin policy]. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

image::https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/cors_principle.png[CORS Principle,65%,65%]

The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between *browsers* and *servers*. Modern browsers use CORS in APIs such as `XMLHttpRequest` or `Fetch` to mitigate the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.

----

The {http-cors-protocol}[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard] works by adding new {http-headers}[HTTP headers] that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser. Additionally, for HTTP request methods that can cause side-effects on server data (in particular, HTTP methods other than {http-methods-get}[GET], or {http-methods-post}[POST] with certain {http-mime-types}[MIME types]), the specification mandates that browsers "*preflight*" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with the HTTP {http-methods-options}[OPTIONS] request method, and then, upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request. Servers can also inform clients whether "credentials" (such as {http-cookies}[Cookies] and {http-authentication}[HTTP Authentication]) should be sent with requests.

[NOTE]
====
CORS failures result in errors, but for security reasons, specifics about the error are not available to JavaScript. All the code knows is that an error occurred. The only way to determine what specifically went wrong is to look at the browser's console for details.
====

=== Simple requests

Some requests don't trigger a {preflight-request}[CORS preflight]. Those are called simple requests, though the {fetch-spec}[Fetch] spec (which defines CORS) doesn't use that term. A simple request is one that meets all the following conditions:

* One of the allowed methods:
** {http-methods-get}[GET]
** {http-methods-head}[HEAD]
** {http-methods-post}[POST]
* Apart from the headers automatically set by the user agent (for example, {http-headers-connection}[Connection], {http-headers-user-Agent}[User-Agent], or the other headers defined in the {fetch-spec}[Fetch] spec as a https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name[forbidden header name]), the only headers which are allowed to be manually set are those which the {fetch-spec}[Fetch] spec defines as a https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header[CORS-safelisted request-header], which are:
** {http-headers-accept}[Accept]
** {http-headers-accept-language}[Accept-Language]
** {http-headers-content-language}[Content-Language]
** {http-headers-content-type}[Content-Type] (but note the additional requirements below)
* The only allowed values for the {http-headers-content-type}[Content-Type] header are:
** application/x-www-form-urlencoded
** multipart/form-data
** text/plain
* If the request is made using an {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] object, no event listeners are registered on the object returned by the `XMLHttpRequest.upload` property used in the request; that is, given an {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] instance `xhr`, no code has called `xhr.upload.addEventListener()` to add an event listener to monitor the upload.
* No {api-readablestream}[ReadableStream] object is used in the request.


For example, suppose web content at `https://foo.example` wishes to invoke content on domain `https://bar.other`. Code of this sort might be used in JavaScript deployed on foo.example:
[source,js]
----
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'https://bar.other/resources/public-data/';

xhr.open('GET', url);
xhr.onreadystatechange = someHandler;
xhr.send();
----

This performs a simple exchange between the client and the server, using CORS headers to handle the privileges:

image::https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/simple-req-updated.png[Sime Requests, 75%, 75%]

Let's look at what the browser will send to the server in this case, and let's see how the server responds:

[source,text]
----
GET /resources/public-data/ HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.other
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Origin: https://foo.example <1>
----

<1> The request header of note is {http-headers-origin}[Origin], which shows that the invocation is coming from `https://foo.example`.

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 00:23:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * <1>
Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/xml

[â€¦XML Dataâ€¦]
----

<1> In response, the server sends back an {http-headers-access-control-allow-origin}[Access-Control-Allow-Origin] header with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, which means that the resource can be accessed by *any* origin.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

This pattern of the {http-headers-origin}[Origin] and {http-headers-access-control-allow-origin}[Access-Control-Allow-Origin] headers is the simplest use of the access control protocol. If the resource owners at `https://bar.other` wished to restrict access to the resource to requests only from `https://foo.example`, (i.e no domain other than `https://foo.example` can access the resource in a cross-site manner) they would send:

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example

[NOTE]
Note: When responding to a link:#requests_with_credentials[credentialed requests] request, the server *must* specify an origin in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, instead of specifying the "`*`" wildcard.

=== Preflighted requests

Unlike link:#simple-requests[simple requests], for "preflighted" requests the browser first sends an HTTP request using the {http-methods-options}[OPTIONS] method to the resource on the other origin, in order to determine if the actual request is safe to send. Cross-site requests are preflighted like this since they may have implications to user data.

The following is an example of a request that will be preflighted:

[source,js]
----
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('POST', 'https://bar.other/resources/post-here/');
xhr.setRequestHeader('X-PINGOTHER', 'pingpong'); <1>
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/xml'); <2>
xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
xhr.send('<person><name>Arun</name></person>');
----

The example above creates an XML body to send with the {http-methods-post}[POST] request.

<1> Also, a non-standard HTTP `X-PINGOTHER` request header is set. Such headers are not part of HTTP/1.1, but are generally useful to web applications.
<2> Since the request uses a {http-headers-content-type}[Content-Type] of `application/xml`, and since a custom header is set, this request is preflighted.

image::https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/preflight_correct.png[Preflight Correct,75%,75%]

[NOTE]
Note: As described below, the actual `POST` request does not include the `Access-Control-Request-*` headers; they are needed only for the `OPTIONS` request.

Let's look at the full exchange between client and server. The first exchange is the preflight _request/response_:

[source,text,linenums]
----
OPTIONS /doc HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.other
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Origin: https://foo.example
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 01:15:39 GMT
Server: Apache/2
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
Vary: Accept-Encoding, Origin
Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
----

Lines 1 - 10 above represent the preflight request with the {http-methods-options}[OPTIONS] method. The browser determines that it needs to send this based on the request parameters that the JavaScript code snippet above was using, so that the server can respond whether it is acceptable to send the request with the actual request parameters. OPTIONS is an HTTP/1.1 method that is used to determine further information from servers, and is a {safe-http}[safe] method, meaning that it can't be used to change the resource. Note that along with the OPTIONS request, two other request headers are sent (lines 9 and 10 respectively):

[source,text]
----
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST <1>
Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type <2>
----

<1> The {http-headers-access-control-request-method}[Access-Control-Request-Method] header notifies the server as part of a preflight request that when the actual request is sent, it will be sent with a `POST` request method.
<2> The {http-headers-access-control-request-headers}[Access-Control-Request-Headers] header notifies the server that when the actual request is sent, it will be sent with a `X-PINGOTHER` and `Content-Type` custom headers. The server now has an opportunity to determine whether it wishes to accept a request under these circumstances.

Lines 13 - 22 above are the response that the server sends back, which indicate that the request method (`POST`) and request headers (`X-PINGOTHER`) are acceptable. In particular, let's look at lines 16-19:

[source,text]
----
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example <1>
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS <2> 
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type <3>
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 <4>
----

<1> The server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example`, restricting access to just the requesting origin domain.
<2> It also responds with {http-headers-access-control-allow-methods}[Access-Control-Allow-Methods], which says that `POST` and `GET` are viable methods to query the resource in question (this header is similar to the {http-headers-allow}[Allow] response header, but used strictly within the context of access control).

<3> The server also sends {http-headers-access-control-allow-headers}[Access-Control-Allow-Headers] with a value of "`X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type`", confirming that these are permitted headers to be used with the actual request. Like `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is a comma-separated list of acceptable headers.

<4> Finally, {http-headers-access-control-max-age}[Access-Control-Max-Age] gives the value in seconds for how long the response to the preflight request can be cached for without sending another preflight request. In this case, 86400 seconds is 24 hours. Note that each browser has a maximum internal value that takes precedence when the `Access-Control-Max-Age` is greater.

Once the preflight request is complete, the real request is sent:

[source,text]

=== Requests with credentials

The most interesting capability exposed by both {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] or {fetch-api}[Fetch] and CORS is the ability to make "credentialed" requests that are aware of {http-cookies}[HTTP cookies] and {http-authentication}[HTTP Authentication] information. By default, in cross-site {xmlhttprequest}[XMLHttpRequest] or {fetch-api}[Fetch] invocations, browsers will not send credentials. A specific flag has to be set on the `XMLHttpRequest` object or the `Request` constructor when it is invoked.

In this example, content originally loaded from `https://foo.example` makes a simple {http-methods-get}[GET] request to a resource on `https://bar.other` which sets Cookies. Content on `foo.example` might contain JavaScript like this:

[source,js,linenums]
----
const invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'https://bar.other/resources/credentialed-content/';

function callOtherDomain() {
  if (invocation) {
    invocation.open('GET', url, true);
    invocation.withCredentials = true; <1>
    invocation.onreadystatechange = handler;
    invocation.send();
  }
}
----

<1> Line 7 shows the flag on `XMLHttpRequest` that has to be set in order to make the invocation with Cookies, namely the `withCredentials` boolean value. By default, the invocation is made without Cookies. Since this is a simple `GET` request, it is not preflighted, but the browser will reject any response that does not have the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header, and not make the response available to the invoking web content.

image::https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/cred-req-updated.png[Credentialed Requests,75%,75%]

Here is a sample exchange between client and server:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
GET /resources/credentialed-content/ HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.other
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: https://foo.example/examples/credential.html
Origin: https://foo.example
Cookie: pageAccess=2 <1>


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 01:34:52 GMT
Server: Apache/2
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Set-Cookie: pageAccess=3; expires=Wed, 31-Dec-2008 01:34:53 GMT
Vary: Accept-Encoding, Origin
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 106
Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/plain

[text/plain payload]
----

<1> Although line 10 contains the Cookie destined for the content on `https://bar.other`, if bar.other did not respond with an `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (line 17) the response would be ignored and not made available to web content.

[NOTE]
CORS-preflight requests must never include credentials. The response to a preflight request must specify `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to indicate that the actual request can be made with credentials.

.Credentialed requests and wildcards
****
When responding to a credentialed request:

* The server *must not* specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit origin; for example: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com`
* The server *must not* specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit list of header names; for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type`
* The server must not specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit list of method names; for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET`

[NOTE]
====
If a request includes a credential (most commonly a Cookie header) and the response includes an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header (that is, with the wildcard), the browser will block access to the response, and report a CORS error in the devtools console.

But if a request includes a credential (like the `Cookie` header) and the response includes an actual origin rather than the wildcard (like, for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com`), then the browser will allow access to the response from the specified origin.

Also note that any `Set-Cookie` response header in a response would not set a cookie if the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` value in that response is the "`*`" wildcard rather an actual origin.
====
****

.Third-party cookies
****
Note that cookies set in CORS responses are subject to normal third-party cookie policies. In the example above, the page is loaded from `foo.example`, but the cookie on line 20 is sent by `bar.other`, and would thus not be saved if the user has configured their browser to reject all third-party cookies.

Cookie in the request (line 10) may also be suppressed in normal third-party cookie policies. The enforced cookie policy may therefore nullify the capability described in this chapter, effectively prevents you from making credentialed requests whatsoever.

Cookie policy around the link:#same-site[SameSite] attribute would apply.
****

=== The HTTP response headers

==== Access-Control-Allow-Origin

A returned resource may have one `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, with the following syntax:

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin> | *

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` specifies either a single origin, which tells browsers to allow that origin to access the resource; or else â€” for requests *without* credentials â€” the "`*`" wildcard, to tell browsers to allow any origin to access the resource.

For example, to allow code from the origin `https://mozilla.org` to access the resource, you can specify:

[source,text]
----
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mozilla.org
Vary: Origin
----

.CORS and caching
****
If the server sends a response with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` value that is an explicit origin (rather than the "`*`" wildcard), then the response should also include a {http-headers-vary}[Vary] response header with the value `Origin` â€” to indicate to browsers that server responses can differ based on the value of the `Origin` request header.
****

==== Access-Control-Expose-Headers

The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header adds the specified headers to the allowlist that JavaScript (such as `getResponseHeader()`) in browsers is allowed to access.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: <header-name>[, <header-name>]*

For example, the following:

[source,text]
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-My-Custom-Header, X-Another-Custom-Header

â€¦would allow the `X-My-Custom-Header` and `X-Another-Custom-Header` headers to be exposed to the browser.

==== Access-Control-Max-Age

The `Access-Control-Max-Age` header indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached. For an example of a preflight request, see the above examples.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Max-Age: <delta-seconds>

The delta-seconds parameter indicates the number of seconds the results can be cached.

==== Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is `true`. When used as part of a response to a preflight request, this indicates whether or not the actual request can be made using credentials. Note that simple `GET` requests are not preflighted, and so if a request is made for a resource with credentials, if this header is not returned with the resource, the response is ignored by the browser and not returned to web content.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

==== Access-Control-Allow-Methods

The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource. This is used in response to a preflight request. The conditions under which a request is preflighted are discussed above.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: <method>[, <method>]*

An example of a preflight request is given above, including an example which sends this header to the browser.

==== Access-Control-Allow-Headers

The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header is used in response to a preflight request to indicate which HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request. This header is the server side response to the browser's `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: <header-name>[, <header-name>]*

=== The HTTP request headers

==== Origin

The `Origin` header indicates the origin of the cross-site access request or preflight request.

[source,text]
Origin: <origin>

The origin is a URL indicating the server from which the request initiated. It does not include any path information, but only the server name.

[NOTE]
====
Note: The origin value can be null.

Note that in any access control request, the `Origin` header is *always* sent.
====

==== Access-Control-Request-Method

The `Access-Control-Request-Method` is used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know what HTTP method will be used when the actual request is made.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Request-Method: <method>

==== Access-Control-Request-Headers

The `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header is used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know what HTTP headers will be used when the actual request is made (such as with `setRequestHeader()`). This browser side header will be answered by the complementary server side header of `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.

[source,text]
Access-Control-Request-Headers: <field-name>[, <field-name>]*

== Domain Name System (DNS)

:fully_qualified_domain_name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name

A *domain name* is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. 

Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the {domain_name_system}[Domain Name System] (*DNS*). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the {top-level_domain}[top-level domains] (**TLD**s), including the {generic_top-level_domain}[generic top-level domains] (**gTLD**s), such as the prominent domains `com`, `info`, `net`, `edu`, and `org`, and the country code top-level domains (**ccTLD**s). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the *second-level* and *third-level* domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.

A {fully_qualified_domain_name}[fully qualified domain name] (*FQDN*) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a *dot* (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts. In contrast to a domain name that is fully specified, a domain name that does not include the full path of labels up to the DNS root is often called a _partially qualified domain name_.

=== Public Suffix List

The *Public Suffix List (PSL)* is a catalog of certain Internet domain names. Entries on the list are also referred to as effective top-level domains (*eTLD*).

.Purpose(s)
****
Previously, browsers used an algorithm which basically only denied setting wide-ranging cookies for top-level domains with no dots (e.g. `com` or `org`). However, this did not work for top-level domains where only third-level registrations are allowed (e.g. `co.uk`). In these cases, websites could set a cookie for `co.uk` which will be passed onto every website registered under [.line-through]#co#`.uk`.

Clearly, this was a security risk as it allowed websites other than the one setting the cookie to read it, and therefore potentially extract sensitive information.

Since there is no algorithmic method of finding the highest level at which a domain may be registered for a particular top-level domain (the policies differ with each registry), the only method is to create a list of all top-level domains and the level at which domains can be registered. This is the aim of the effective TLD list. 
****

.Site
****
The site of a piece of web content is determined by the *registrable domain* of the host within the origin. This is computed by consulting a *Public Suffix List* to find the portion of the host which is counted as the public suffix (e.g. `com`, `org` or `co.uk`).

The concept of a site is used in `SameSite` cookies, as well as a web application's `Cross-Origin Resource Policy`.

.Examples of the same site
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|pass:[https]://developer.#mozilla.org#/en-US/docs/
pass:[https]://support.#mozilla.org#/en-US/
|same site because the registrable domain of mozilla.org is the same

|pass:[http]://#example.com#:8080
pass:[https]://#example.com#
|same site because scheme and port are not relevant
|===

.Examples of different site
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|pass:[https]://developer.#mozilla.org#/en-US/docs/
pass:[https]://#example.com#
.2+|not same site because the registrable domain of the two URLs differs

|pass:[https]://#example.co.uk#
pass:[https]://#example.uk#

== Same-Site and Cross-Site Requests

A request is "same-site" if its target's URI's origin's *registrable domain* is an exact match for the request's initiator's "site for cookies", and "cross-site" otherwise.  To be more precise, for a given request ("request"), the following algorithm returns "same-site" or "cross-site":

1.  If "request"'s client is "null", return "same-site".
2.  Let "site" be "request"'s client's "site for cookies".
3.  Let "target" be the registrable domain of "request"'s current url.
4.  If "site" is an exact match for "target", return "same-site".
5.  Return "cross-site".
