RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While LLMs excel at generating text, they often lack context and struggle to understand the deeper meaning behind user queries. RAG bridges this gap by incorporating information retrieval to provide LLMs with relevant context, leading to improved response quality.

== How does RAG work?

RAG is a pattern which uses your data with an LLM to generate answers specific to your data. When a user asks a question, the data store is searched based on user input. The user question is then combined with the matching results and sent to the LLM using a prompt (explicit instructions to an AI or machine learning model) to generate the desired answer. This can be illustrated as follows. <<ms-az-ai-rag>>

. User Input: The user provides a query or prompt.

. Vector Search: A vector database (like Milvus) efficiently retrieves documents or passages most relevant to the user's query based on semantic similarity.

. Context Enrichment: Techniques like summarization, keyphrase extraction, or entity recognition are applied to the retrieved information, providing context for the LLM.

. Prompt Construction: The user's original query is combined with the extracted context to form a new, enriched prompt for the LLM.

. Enhanced Generation: The LLM leverages the enriched prompt to generate a more informative and relevant response that addresses the user's specific intent and considers the retrieved context.

While Milvus and GPT-like LLMs are key players, consider these additional aspects for a well-rounded RAG system:

* Machine Learning Fundamentals: Understanding concepts like word embeddings and information retrieval is crucial.

* Alternative Tools: Explore other vector databases and pre-trained word embedding models.

* Prompt Construction Techniques: Utilize template-based prompts, conditional logic, or fine-tuning for automatic prompt generation.

* Evaluation: Continuously monitor performance to identify areas for improvement.

In essence, RAG empowers LLMs to become more contextually aware, leading to a more informative and engaging user experience.

== Deep Dive into Context Enrichment for RAG Systems

Context enrichment is a crucial step in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) that bridges the gap between a user's query and the LLM's response. It involves processing the information retrieved from the vector database (like Milvus) to provide the LLM with a deeper understanding of the user's intent and the relevant context.

Here's a breakdown of some popular libraries and techniques for context enrichment:

1. Text Summarization:

* Goal: Condense retrieved documents into concise summaries for the LLM to grasp the key points.

* Libraries:

** Gensim (Python): Offers various summarization techniques, including extractive (selecting important sentences) and abstractive (generating a new summary).

** BART (Transformers library): A powerful pre-trained model specifically designed for text summarization.

2. Keyword Extraction:

* Goal: Identify the most relevant keywords or keyphrases within retrieved documents to highlight the main themes.

* Libraries:

** spaCy (Python): Provides functionalities for part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and keyword extraction.

** NLTK (Python): A comprehensive toolkit for various NLP tasks, including keyword extraction using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

3. Named Entity Recognition (NER):

* Goal: Recognize and classify named entities (people, locations, organizations) within retrieved text, enriching the context for the LLM.

* Libraries:

** spaCy: Offers pre-trained NER models for various languages, allowing the LLM to understand the context of specific entities.
** Stanford NER: A widely used Java-based library for named entity recognition.

*Choosing the Right Technique:*

The best approach for context enrichment depends on your specific needs and the type of data you're working with. Here's a quick guide:

* For factual or informative responses: Text summarization can be highly effective.

* For understanding the main topics: Keyword extraction is a good choice.

* For tasks involving specific entities: Named entity recognition becomes crucial.

*Advanced Techniques:*

* Combining Techniques: Don't be limited to a single approach. Combine summarization with keyword extraction or NER to provide richer context to the LLM.

* Custom Summarization Models: For specialized domains, consider training custom summarization models using domain-specific data.

== Automatic Prompt Construction

Several approaches can automate prompt construction based on user input and extracted context:

* Template-Based Prompts: Pre-defined templates can be used to structure the prompt, incorporating user query and extracted elements (e.g., "{user_query}: Based on similar content, here are some key points: {key_phrases}. Can you elaborate?").

* Conditional Logic: Conditional statements can be used based on the chosen context enrichment technique. For example, if using summaries, the prompt might say "Here's a summary of relevant information..." while using keyphrases, it might mention "Here are some key points..."

* Fine-tuning Language Models: Techniques like fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs can be explored to allow them to automatically learn how to integrate user queries and retrieved context into a cohesive prompt. This is an advanced approach requiring expertise in machine learning.

*Choosing the Right Tool:*

The best tool or approach depends on your specific needs and available resources. Here's a basic guideline:

* Simpler Systems: For less complex RAG systems, template-based prompts with basic summarization or keyword extraction tools might suffice.

* Advanced Systems: For more sophisticated applications, consider exploring conditional logic, fine-tuning LLMs, or combining different context enrichment techniques to create richer prompts.

By combining vector databases with the right context enrichment tools and automatic prompt construction techniques, we can build a robust RAG system that leverages the power of LLMs to generate more informative and relevant responses.

== Build RAG with Milvus

We will use https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi-3[Phi-3], an open small language model, to provide an OpenAI-compatible API.
