Every device connected to the Internet has at least one IP address. Devices used in private networks based on the TCP/IP protocols also require IP addresses.

In either case, the forwarding procedures implemented by IP routers use IP addresses to identify where traffic is going. IP addresses also indicate where traffic has come from.

IP addresses are similar in some ways to telephone numbers, but whereas telephone numbers are often known and used directly by end users.

IP addresses are often shielded from a user's view by the Internet's DNS, which allows most users to use names instead of numbers.

== Expressing IP Address

The vast majority of Internet users who are familiar with IP addresses understand the most popular type: *IPv4* addresses. Such addresses are often represented in so-called dotted-quad or dotted-decimal notation.

In *IPv6*, addresses are 128 bits in length, four times larger than IPv4 addresses, and generally speaking are less familiar to most users. The conventional notation adopted for IPv6 addresses is a series of four hexadecimal ("hex," or base-16) numbers called _blocks_ or _fields_ separated by colons.

Although not as familiar to users as decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers make the task of converting to binary somewhat simpler. In addition, a number of agreed-upon simplifications have been standardized for expressing IPv6 addresses [RFC4291]:

. Leading zeros of a block need not be written.
+
For example, the address _5f05:2000:80ad:5800:0058:0800:2023:1d71_ can been written as _5f05:2000:80ad:5800:58:800:2023:1d71_.

. Blocks of all zeros can be omitted and replaced by the notation _::_.
+
For example, the IPv6 address _0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1_ can be written more compactly as _::1_. Similarly, the address _2001:0db8:0:0:0:0:0:2_ can be written more compactly
as _2001:db8::2_.
+
To avoid ambiguities, the _::_ notation may be used only once in an IPv6 address.

. Embedded IPv4 addresses represented in the IPv6 format can use a form of hybrid notation in which the block immediately preceding the IPv4 portion of the address has the value ffff and the remaining part of the address is formatted using dotted-quad.
+
For example, the IPv6 address _::ffff:10.0.0.1_ represents the IPv4 address _10.0.0.1_. This is called an _IPv4-mapped IPv6 address_.

. A conventional notation is adopted in which the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address can be written using dotted-quad notation.
+
The IPv6 address _::0102:f001_ is therefore equivalent to the address _::1.2.240.1_. This is called an _IPv4-compatible IPv6 address_.
+
Note that IPv4-compatible addresses are not the same as IPv4-mapped addresses; they are compatible only in the sense that they can be written down or manipulated by software in a way similar to IPv4 addresses.

|===

In some circumstances (e.g., when expressing a URL containing an address) the colon delimiter in an IPv6 address may be confused with another separator
such as the colon used between an IP address and a port number. In such circumstances, bracket characters, _[_ and _]_, are used to surround the IPv6 address.

For example, the URL _http://[2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344]:443/_ refers to port number _443_ on IPv6 host _2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344_ using the HTTP/TCP/IPv6 protocols.

== Basic IP Address Structure

Because of the large number of addresses (especially for IPv6), it is convenient to divide the address space into chunks. IP addresses are grouped by type and size.

Most of the IPv4 address chunks are eventually subdivided down to a single address and used to identify a single network interface of a computer attached to the Internet or to some private intranet. These addresses are called *unicast* addresses.

Beyond *unicast addresses*, other types of addresses include *broadcast*, *multicast*, and *anycast*, which may refer to more than one interface, plus some special-purpose addresses.

=== Classful Addressing

When the Internet’s address structure was originally defined, every unicast IP address had a _network_ portion, to identify the network on which the interface using the IP address was to be found, and a _host_ portion, used to identify the particular host on the network given in the network portion. Thus, some number of contiguous bits in the address became known as the _net number_, and remaining bits were known as the _host number_. At the time, most hosts had only a single network interface, so the terms _interface address_ and _host address_ were used somewhat interchangeably.

With the realization that different networks might have different numbers of hosts, and that each host requires a unique IP address, a partitioning was devised wherein different-size allocation units of IP address space could be given out to different sites, based on their current and projected number of hosts. The partitioning of the address space involved *five classes*. Each class represented a different trade-off in the number of bits of a 32-bit IPv4 address devoted to the network number versus the number of bits devoted to the host number.

=== Subnet Addressing

One of the earliest difficulties encountered when the Internet began to grow was the inconvenience of having to allocate a new network number for any new network segment that was to be attached to the Internet. This became especially cumbersome with the development and increasing use of local area networks (LANs) in the early 1980s.

To address the problem, it was natural to consider a way that a site attached to the Internet could be allocated a network number centrally that could then be subdivided locally by site administrators. If this could be accomplished without altering the rest of the Internet's core routing infrastructure, so much the better.

Implementing this idea would require the ability to alter the line between the network portion of an IP address and the host portion, but only for local purposes at a site; the rest of the Internet would "see" only the traditional class A, B, and C partitions. The approach adopted to support this capability is called *subnet addressing*[RFC0950].

Using subnet addressing, a site is allocated a class A, B, or C network number, leaving some number of remaining host bits to be further allocated and assigned within a site. The site may further divide the host portion of its base address allocation into a *subnetwork* (subnet) number and a host number.

In exchange for the additional flexibility provided by subnet addressing, a new cost is imposed. Because the definition of the *Subnet* and *Host* fields is now site-specific (not dictated by the class of the network number), all routers and hosts at a site require a new way to determine where the Subnet field of the address and the Host field of the address are located within the address. Before subnets, this information could be derived directly by knowing whether a network number was from class A, B, or C (as indicated by the first few bits in the address).

.An example of a subnetted class B address. Using 8 bits for the subnet ID provides for 256 subnets with 254 hosts on each of the subnets. This partitioning may be altered by the network administrator.

|===

This particular configuration allows the site to support 256 subnetworks, and each subnetwork may contain up to 254 hosts (now the first and last addresses for each subnetwork are not available, as opposed to losing only the first and last addresses of the entire allocated range). Recall that the subnetwork structure is known only by hosts and routers where the subnetting is taking place. The remainder of the Internet still treats any address associated with the site just as it did prior to the advent of subnet addressing.

.A site is allocated the classical class B network number 128.32. The network administrator decides to apply a site-wide subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, giving 256 subnetworks where each subnetwork can hold 256 – 2 = 254 hosts. The IPv4 address of each host on the same subnet has the subnetwork number in common. All of the IPv4 addresses of hosts on the left-hand LAN segment start with 128.32.1, and all of those on the right start with 128.32.2.

=== Subnet mask

The *subnet mask* is an assignment of bits used by a host or router to determine how the network and subnetwork information is partitioned from the host information in a corresponding IP address. Subnet masks for IP are the same length as the corresponding IP addresses (32 bits for IPv4 and 128 bits for IPv6). They are typically configured into a host or router in the same way as IP addresses—either statically (typical for routers) or using some dynamic system such as the _Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol_ (DHCP). For IPv4, subnet masks may be written in the same way an IPv4 address is written (i.e., dotted-decimal).

Although not originally required to be arranged in this manner, today subnet masks are structured as some number of 1 bits followed by some number of 0 bits. Because of this arrangement, it is possible to use a shorthand format for expressing masks that simply gives the number of contiguous 1 bits in the mask (starting from the left). This format is now the most common format and is sometimes called the *prefix length*.

Masks are used by routers and hosts to determine where the network/subnetwork portion of an IP address ends and the host part begins. A bit set to 1 in the subnet mask means the corresponding bit position in an IP address should be considered part of a combined network/subnetwork portion of an address, which is used as the basis for forwarding datagrams. Conversely, a bit set to 0 in the subnet mask means the corresponding bit position in an IP address should be considered part of the host portion.

.An IP address can be combined with a subnet mask using a bitwise AND operation in order to form the network/subnetwork identifier (prefix) of the address used for routing. In this example, applying a mask of length 24 to the IPv4 address 128.32.1.14 gives the prefix 128.32.1.0/24.
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/ip-network-subnet.png[,75%,75%]

=== Variable-Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)

It is possible to use a different-length subnet mask applied to the same network number in different portions of the same site. Although doing this complicates address configuration management, it adds flexibility to the subnet structure because different subnetworks may be set up with different numbers of hosts. *Variable-length subnet masks* (VLSM) are now supported by most hosts, routers, and routing protocols.

.VLSM can be used to partition a network number into subnetworks with a differing number of hosts on each subnet. Each router and host is configured with a subnet mask in addition to its IP address. Most software supports VLSM, except for some older routing protocols (e.g., RIP version 1).
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/vlsm.png[Variable-Length Subnet Masks,75%,75%]

Recall that the number of hosts is constrained by the number of bits remaining in the IP address that are not used by the network/subnet number. For IPv4
and a /24 prefix, this allows for 32 – 24 = 8 bits (256 hosts); for /25, half as many (128 hosts); and for /26, half further still (64 hosts).

Note that each interface on each host and router depicted is now given both an IP address and a subnet mask, but the mask differs across the network topology.

With an appropriate dynamic routing protocol running among the routers (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS, RIPv2), traffic is able to flow correctly among hosts at the same site or to/from the outside of the site across the Internet.

Although it may not seem obvious, there is a common case where a subnetwork contains only two hosts. When routers are connected together by a point-to-point link requiring an IP address to be assigned at each end, it is common practice to use a /31 network prefix with IPv4, and it is now also a recommended practice to use a /127 prefix for IPv6 [RFC6164].

=== Broadcast Address

In each IPv4 subnetwork, a special address is reserved to be the *subnet broadcast address*. The subnet broadcast address is formed by setting the network/subnetwork portion of an IPv4 address to the appropriate value and all the bits in the Host field to 1.

.The subnet broadcast address is formed by ORing the complement of the subnet mask with the IPv4 address. In this case of a /24 subnet mask, all of the remaining 32 – 24 = 8 bits are set to 1, giving a decimal value of 255 and the subnet broadcast address of 128.32.1.255.
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/subnet-broadcast-address.png[Subnet Broadcast Address,75%,75%]

Historically, a datagram using this type of address as its destination has also been known as a *directed broadcast*. Such a broadcast can, at least theoretically, be routed through the Internet as a single datagram until reaching the target subnetwork, at which point it becomes a collection of broadcast datagrams that are delivered to all hosts on the subnetwork.

In addition to the subnet broadcast address, the special-use address _255.255.255.255_ is reserved as the *local net broadcast* (also called *limited broadcast*), which is never forwarded by routers.

Note that although routers may not forward broadcasts, subnet broadcasts and local net broadcasts destined for the same network to which a computer is attached should be expected to work unless explicitly disabled by end hosts. Such broadcasts do not require action by a router; _link-layer broadcast_ mechanisms, if available, are used for supporting them.

Broadcast addresses are typically used with protocols such as UDP/IP (Chapter 10) or ICMP because these protocols do not involve two-party conversations as in TCP/IP.

IPv6 lacks any broadcast addresses; for places where broadcast addresses might be used in IPv4, IPv6 instead uses exclusively multicast addresses.

=== IPv6 Addresses and Interface Identifiers

In addition to being longer than IPv4 addresses by a factor of 4, IPv6 addresses also have some additional structure. Special prefixes used with IPv6 addresses indicate the *scope* of an address. The scope of an IPv6 address refers to the portion of the network where it can be used.

Important examples of scopes include *node-local* (the address can be used only for communication on the same computer), *link-local* (used only among nodes on the same network link or IPv6 prefix), or *global* (Internet-wide).

In IPv6, most nodes have more than one address in use, often on the same network interface. Although this is supported in IPv4 as well, it is not nearly as common.

Link-local IPv6 addresses (and some global IPv6 addresses) use *interface identifiers* (IIDs) as a basis for unicast IPv6 address assignment.

IIDs are used as the low-order bits of an IPv6 address in all cases except where the address begins with the binary value 000, and as such they must be unique within the same network prefix.

IIDs are ordinarily 64 bits long and are formed either directly from the underlying link-layer MAC address of a network interface using a *modified EUI-64 format* [EUI64], or by another process that randomizes the value in hopes of providing some degree of privacy against address tracking.

In IEEE standards, EUI stands for *extended unique identifier*.

* EUI-64 identifiers start with a _24-bit_ *Organizationally Unique Identifier* (OUI) followed by a _40-bit_ *extension identifier* assigned by the organization, which is identified by the first 24 bits.
* The OUIs are maintained and allocated by the IEEE registration authority [IEEERA].
* EUIs may be "universally administered" or "locally administered."
* In the Internet context, such addresses are typically of the universally administered variety.

Many IEEE standards-compliant network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet) have used shorter-format addresses (48-bit EUIs) for years. The only significant difference between the EUI-48 and EUI-64 formats is their length.

.The EUI-48 and EUI-64 formats defined by the IEEE. These are used within IPv6 to form interface identifiers by inverting the u bit.
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/EUI-48-and-EUI-64-formats.png[EUI-48 and EUI-64 formats,75%,75%]

The OUI is 24 bits long and occupies the first 3 bytes of both EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses. The low-order 2 bits of the first bytes of these addresses are designated the _u_ and _g_ bits, respectively.

* The _u_ bit, when set, indicates that the address is locally administered.
* The _g_ bit, when set, indicates that the address is a group or multicast-type address.

An EUI-64 can be formed from an EUI-48 by copying the 24-bit OUI value from the EUI-48 address to the EUI-64 address, placing the 16-bit value, hex FFFE in the fourth and fifth bytes of the EUI-64 address, and then copying the remaining organization-assigned bits.

----

Here we can see how the Ethernet’s hardware address _00:0c:29:85:26:07_ is mapped to an IPv6 address.

* First, it is converted to EUI-64, forming the address _00:0c:29:ff:fe:85:26:07_.
* Next, the _u_ bit is inverted, forming the IID value _02:0c:29:ff:fe:85:26:07_.
* To complete the link-local IPv6 address, we use the reserved link-local prefix _fe80::/10_.
* Together, these form the complete address, _fe80::20c:29ff:fe85:2607_.
* The presence of _/64_ is the standard length used for identifying the subnetwork/host portion of an IPv6 address derived from an IID as required by [RFC4291].

== CIDR and Aggregation

In the early 1990s, after the adoption of subnet addressing to ease one form of growing pains, the Internet started facing a serious set of scaling problems. Three particular issues were considered so important as to require immediate attention:

1. By 1994, over half of all class B addresses had already been allocated. It was expected that the class B address space would be exhausted by about 1995.
2. The 32-bit IPv4 address was thought to be inadequate to handle the size of the Internet anticipated by the early 2000s.
3. The number of entries in the global routing table (one per network number), about 65,000 in 1995, was growing. As more and more class A, B, and C routing entries appeared, routing performance would suffer.

These three issues were attacked by a group in the IETF called ROAD (for ROuting and ADdressing), starting in 1992. They considered problems 1 and 3 to be of immediate concern, and problem 2 as requiring a long-term solution. The short-term solution they proposed was to effectively remove the class breakdown of IP addresses and also promote the ability to aggregate hierarchically assigned IP addresses. These measures would help problems 1 and 3. IPv6 was envisioned to deal with problem 2.

=== Prefixes

In order to help relieve the pressure on the availability of IPv4 addresses (especially class B addresses), the classful addressing scheme was generalized using a scheme similar to VLSM, and the Internet routing system was extended to support *Classless Inter-Domain Routing* (CIDR) [RFC4632]. This provided a way to conveniently allocate contiguous address ranges that contained more than 255 hosts but fewer than 65,536. That is, something other than single class B or multiple class C network numbers could be allocated to sites.

Using CIDR, any address range is not predefined as being part of a class but instead requires a mask similar to a subnet mask, sometimes called a *CIDR mask*. CIDR masks are not limited to a site but are instead visible to the global routing system. Thus, the core Internet routers must be able to interpret and process masks in addition to network numbers. This combination of numbers, called a *network prefix*, is used for both IPv4 and IPv6 address management.

Eliminating the predefined separation of network and host number within an IP address makes finer-grain allocation of IP address ranges possible.

* As with classful addressing, dividing the address spaces into chunks is most easily achieved by grouping numerically contiguous addresses for use as a type or for some particular special purpose.
* Such groupings are now commonly expressed using a prefix of the address space.
** An n-bit prefix is a predefined value for the first n bits of an address.
** The value of n (the length of the prefix) is typically expressed as an integer in the range 0–32 for IPv4 and 0–128 for IPv6.
** It is generally appended to the base IP address following a _/_ character.

In the table, the bits defined and fixed by the prefix are highlighted. The remaining bits may be set to any combination of 0s and 1s, thereby covering the possible address range.

* Clearly, a smaller prefix length corresponds to a larger number of possible addresses.
* In addition, the earlier classful addressing approach is easily generalized by this scheme.
** For example, the class _C_ network number _192.125.3.0_ can be written as the prefix _192.125.3.0/24_ or _192.125.3/24_.
** Classful _A_ and _B_ network numbers can be expressed using _/8_ and _/16_ prefix lengths, respectively.

Removing the classful structure of IP addresses made it possible to allocate IP address blocks in a wider variety of sizes. Doing so, however, did not address the third concern from the list of problems; it did not help to reduce the number of routing table entries.

A routing table entry tells a router where to send traffic.

Essentially, the router inspects the destination IP address in an arriving datagram, finds a matching routing table entry, and from the entry extracts the "*next hop*" for the datagram.

At the time, few techniques were known to dramatically reduce the number of routing table entries while maintaining shortest-path routes to all destinations in the Internet. The best-known approach was published in a study of hierarchical routing [KK77] in the late 1970s by Kleinrock and Kamoun. They observed that if the network topology were arranged as a *tree* and addresses were assigned in a way that was "sensitive" to this topology, very small routing tables could be used while still maintaining shortest-path routes to all destinations.

.In a network with a tree topology, network addresses can be assigned in a special way so as to limit the amount of routing information (“state”) that needs to be stored in a router. If addresses are not assigned in this way (left side), shortest-path routes cannot be guaranteed without storing an amount of state proportional to the number of nodes to be reached. While assigning addresses in a way that is sensitive to the tree topology saves state, if the network topology changes, a reassignment of addresses is generally required.
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/a-network-with-tree-topology.png[A network with a tree topology,65%,65%]

In this figure, circles represent routers and lines represent network links between them.

* The root (top) of the tree on the left is the router labeled _19.12.4.8_. In order to know a next hop for every possible destination, it needs an entry for all the routers "below" it in the tree: _190.16.11.2_, _86.12.0.112_, _159.66.2.231_, _133.17.97.12_, _66.103.2.19_, _18.1.1.1_, _19.12.4.9_, and _203.44.23.198_. For any other destination, it simply routes to the cloud labeled "Other Parts of the Network." This results in a total of nine entries.

* In contrast, the root of the right-hand tree is labeled _19.0.0.1_ and requires only three entries in its routing table. Note that all of the routers on the left side of the right tree begin with the prefix _19.1_ and all to the right begin with _19.2_. Thus, the table in router _19.0.0.1_ need only show _19.1.0.1_ as the next hop for any destination starting with _19.1_, whereas _19.2.0.1_ is the next hop for any destination starting with _19.2_. Any other destination goes to the cloud labeled "Other Parts of the Network." This results in a total of three entries.

In the Internet context, the hierarchical routing idea can be used in a specific way to reduce the number of Internet routing entries that would be required otherwise. This is accomplished by a procedure known as *route aggregation*. It works by joining multiple numerically adjacent IP prefixes into a single shorter prefix (called an *aggregate* or *summary*) that covers more address space.

.In this example, the arrows indicate aggregation of two address prefixes to form one; the underlined prefixes are additions in each step. In the first step, 190.154.27.0/26 and 190.154.27.64.0/26 can be aggregated because they are numerically adjacent, but 190.154.27.192/26 cannot. With the addition of 190.154.27.128/26, they can all be aggregated together in two steps to form 190.154.27.0/24. With the final addition of the adjacent 190.154.26.0/24, the aggregate 190.154.26.0/23 is produced.

== Special-Use Addresses

Both the IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces include a few address ranges that are used for special purposes (and are therefore not used in assigning unicast addresses).

For both IPv4 and IPv6, address ranges not designated as special, multicast, or reserved are available to be assigned for unicast use. Some unicast address space
(prefixes _10/8_, _172.16/12_, and _192.168/16_ for IPv4 and _fc00::/7_ for IPv6) is reserved for building private networks. Addresses from these ranges can be used by cooperating hosts and routers within a site or organization, but not across the global Internet. Thus, these addresses are sometimes called *nonroutable addresses*. That is, they will not be routed by the public Internet.

The management of private, nonroutable address space is entirely a local decision. The IPv4 private addresses are very common in home networks and for the internal networks of moderately sized and large enterprises. They are frequently used in combination with *network address translation* (NAT), which rewrites IP addresses inside IP datagrams as they enter the Internet.

=== Multicast Addresses

Multicast addressing is supported by IPv4 and IPv6. An IP multicast address (also called *group* or *group address*) identifies a group of host interfaces, rather than a single one. Generally speaking, the group could span the entire Internet.

The portion of the network that a single group covers is known as the groupi's *scope* [RFC2365]. Common scopes include *node-local* (same computer), *link-local* (same subnet), *site-local* (applicable to some site), *global* (entire Internet), and *administrative*.

Administrative scoped addresses may be used in an area of the network that has been manually configured into routers. A site administrator may configure routers as admin-scope boundaries, meaning that multicast traffic of the associated group is not forwarded past the router. Note that the site-local and administrative scopes are available for use only with multicast addressing.

Under software control, the protocol stack in each Internet host is able to join or leave a multicast group. When a host sends something to a group, it creates a datagram using one of its own (unicast) IP addresses as the source address and a multicast IP address as the destination. All hosts in scope that have joined the group should receive any datagrams sent to the group. The sender is not generally aware of the hosts receiving the datagram unless they explicitly reply. Indeed, the sender does not even know in general how many hosts are receiving its datagrams.

=== IPv4 Multicast Addresses

For IPv4, the class D space (_224.0.0.0_–_239.255.255.255_) with 28 bits free has been reserved for supporting multicast.

The blocks of addresses up to _224.255.255.255_ are allocated for the exclusive use of certain application protocols or organizations. These are allocated as the result of action by the IANA or by the IETF.

The local network control block is limited to the local network of the sender; datagrams sent to those addresses are never forwarded by multicast routers. The All Hosts group (_224.0.0.1_) is one group in this block.

The internetwork control block is similar to the local network control range but is intended for control traffic that needs to be routed off the local link. An example from this block is the Network Time Protocol (NTP) multicast group (_224.0.1.1_) [RFC5905].

=== IPv6 Multicast Addresses

For IPv6, which is considerably more aggressive in its use of multicast, the prefix _ff00::/8_ has been reserved for multicast addresses, and 112 bits are available for holding the group number.

.The base IPv6 multicast address format includes 4 flag bits (0, reserved; R, contains rendezvous point; P, uses unicast prefix; T, is transient). The 4-bit Scope value indicates the scope of the multicast (global, local, etc.). The Group ID is encoded in the low-order 112 bits. If the P or R bit is set, an alternative format is used.

Many IPv6 multicast addresses allocated by the IANA for permanent use intentionally span multiple scopes. Each of these is defined with a certain offset relative to every scope (such addresses are called *scope-relative* or *variable-scope* for this reason). For example, the variable-scope multicast address _ff0x::101_ is reserved for NTP servers by [IP6MA]. The _x_ indicates variable scope.

=== Anycast Address

An *anycast address* is a unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address that identifies a different host depending on where in the network it is used. This is accomplished by configuring Internet routers to advertise the same unicast routes from multiple locations in the Internet. Thus, an anycast address refers not to a single host in the Internet, but to the "most appropriate" or "closest" single host that is responding to the anycast address.

Anycast addressing is used most frequently for finding a computer that provides a common service [RFC4786].

== Allocation

IP address space is *allocated*, usually in large chunks, by a collection of hierarchically organized *authorities*.

The authorities are generally organizations that allocate address space to various owners—usually ISPs or other smaller authorities.

Authorities are most often involved in allocating portions of the global unicast address space, but other types of addresses (multicast and special-use) are also sometimes allocated. The authorities can make allocations to users for an undetermined amount of time, or for a limited time (e.g., for running experiments).

The top of the hierarchy is the IANA [IANA], which has wide-ranging responsibility for allocating IP addresses and other types of numbers used in the Internet protocols.

=== Unicast

For unicast IPv4 and IPv6 address space, the IANA delegates much of its allocation authority to a few *regional Internet registries* (RIRs). The RIRs coordinate with each other through an organization formed in 2003 called the *Number Resource Organization* (NRO).

These entities typically deal with relatively large address blocks. They allocate address space to smaller registries operating in countries (e.g., Australia and Singapore) and to large ISPs.

ISPs, in turn, provide address space to their customers and themselves. When users sign up for Internet service, they are ordinarily provided a (typically small) fraction or range of their ISP's address space in the form of an address prefix.

These address ranges are owned and managed by the customer's ISP and are called *provider-aggregatable* (PA) addresses because they consist of one or more prefixes that can be aggregated with other prefixes the ISP owns. Such addresses are also sometimes called *non-portable* addresses.

Switching providers typically requires customers to change the IP prefixes on all computers and routers they have that are attached to the Internet (an often unpleasant operation called renumbering).

An alternative type of address space is called *provider-independent* (PI) address space. Addresses allocated from PI space are allocated to the user directly and may be used with any ISP. However, because such addresses are owned by the customer, they are not numerically adjacent to the ISP's own addresses and are therefore not aggregatable.

An ISP being asked to provide routing for a customer's PI addresses may require additional payment for service or simply not agree to support such a configuration. In some sense, an ISP that agrees to provide routing for a customer's PI addresses is taking on an extra cost relative to other customers by having to increase the size of its routing tables. On the other hand, many sites prefer to use PI addresses, and might be willing to pay extra for them, because it helps to avoid the need to renumber when switching ISPs (avoiding what has become known as provider lock).

It is possible to use the Internet WHOIS service to determine how address space has been allocated. For example, we can form a query for information about the
IPv4 address _72.1.140.203_ by accessing the corresponding URL http://whois.arin.net/rest/ip/72.1.140.203.txt:

== Unicast Address Assignment

Once a site has been allocated a range of unicast IP addresses, typically from its ISP, the site or network administrator must determine how to assign addresses in
the address range to each network interface and how to set up the subnet structure.

=== Single Provider/No Network/Single Address

The simplest type of Internet service that can be obtained today is to receive a single IP address (typically IPv4 only in the United States) from an ISP to be used with a single computer. For services such as DSL, the single address might be assigned as the end of a point-to-point link and might be temporary.

=== Single Provider/Single Network/Single Address

Many Internet users who own more than one computer find that having only a single computer attached to the Internet is not an ideal situation. As a result, they have home LAN or WLAN networks and use either a router or a computer acting as a router to provide connectivity to the Internet. Such configurations are very similar to the single-computer case, except the router forwards packets from the home network to the ISP and also performs *NAT* (also called *Internet Connection Sharing* (ICS) in Windows) by rewriting the IP addresses in packets being exchanged with the customer's ISP. From the ISP's point of view, only a single IP address has been used.

Today, much of this activity is automated, so the need for manual address configuration is minimal. The routers provide automatic address assignment to the home clients using *DHCP*. They also handle address assignment for the link set up with the ISP if necessary.

=== Single Provider/Multiple Networks/Multiple Addresses

Many organizations find that the allocation of a single unicast address, especially if it is only temporarily assigned, is insufficient for their Internet access needs.

In particular, organizations intending to run Internet servers (such as Web sites) generally wish to have an IP address that does not change over time. These sites also often have multiple LANs; some of them are internal (separated from the Internet by firewalls and NAT devices), and others may be external (providing services to the Internet). For such networks, there is typically a site or network administrator who must decide how many IP addresses the site requires, how to structure subnets at the site, and which subnets should be internal and which external.

.A typical small to medium-size enterprise network. The site has been allocated 64 public (routable) IPv4 addresses in the range 128.32.2.64/26. A DMZ network holds servers that are visible to the Internet. The internal router provides Internet access for computers internal to the enterprise using NAT.

=== Multiple Providers/Multiple Networks/Multiple Addresses (Multihoming)

Some organizations that depend on Internet access for their continued operations attach to the Internet using more than one provider (called *multihoming*) in order to provide for redundancy in case of failure, or for other reasons.

Because of CIDR, organizations with a single ISP tend to have PA IP addresses associated with that ISP. If they obtain a second ISP, the question arises as to what IP addresses should be used in each of the hosts.

Some guidance has been developed for operating with multiple ISPs, or when transitioning from one to another (which raises some similar concerns). For IPv4, [RFC4116] discusses how either PI or PA addresses can be used for multihoming.

.Provider-aggregatable and provider-independent IPv4 addresses used in a hypothetical multihomed enterprise. Site operators tend to prefer using PI space if it is available. ISPs prefer PA space because it promotes prefix aggregation and reduces routing table size.
image::/assets/internet-address-architecture/pa-pi-multihoming.png[Provider-aggregatable and provider-independent IPv4 addresses used in a hypothetical multihomed enterprise,55%,55%]

Here, a (somewhat) fictitious site S has two ISPs, P1 and P2.

If it uses PA address space from P1's block (_12.46.129.0/25_), it advertises this prefix at points C and D to P1 and P2, respectively. The prefix can be aggregated by P1 into its _12/8_ block in advertisements to the rest of the Internet at point A, but P2 is not able to aggregate it at point B because it is not numerically adjacent to its own prefix (_137.164/16_).

In addition, from the point of view of some host in the other parts of the Internet, traffic for _12.46.129.0/25_ tends to go through ISP P2 rather than ISP P1 because the prefix for site S is longer than when it goes through P1. This is a consequence of the way the *longest matching prefix* algorithm works for Internet routing.

In essence, a host in the other parts of the Internet could reach the address _12.46.129.1_ via either a matching prefix _12.0.0.0/8_ at point A or the prefix _12.46.129.0/25_ at point B. Because each prefix matches (i.e., contains a common set of prefix bits with the destination address _12.46.129.1_), the one with the larger or longer mask (larger number of matching bits) is preferred, which in this case is P2. Thus, P2 is in the position of being unable to aggregate the prefix from S and also winds up carrying most of S's traffic.

If site S decides to use PI space instead of PA space, the situation is more symmetric.

However, no aggregation is possible. In this case, the PI prefix _198.134.135.0/24_ is advertised to P1 and P2 at points C and D, respectively, but neither ISP is able to aggregate it because it is not numerically adjacent to either of the ISPs' address blocks. Thus, both ISPs advertise the identical prefix _198.134.135.0/24_ at points A and B. In this fashion the "natural" shortest-path computations in Internet routing can take place, and site S can be reached by whichever ISP is closer to the host sending to it. In addition, if site S decides to switch ISPs, it does not have to change its assigned addresses. Unfortunately, the inability to aggregate such addresses can be a concern for future scalability of the Internet, so PI space is in relatively short supply.

Multihoming for IPv6 has been the subject of study within the IETF for some time, resulting in the *Multi6* architecture [RFC4177] and the *Shim6* protocol [RFC5533].
