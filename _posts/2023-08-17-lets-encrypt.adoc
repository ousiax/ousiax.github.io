== Introduction

Let's Encrypt is a widely used Certificate Authority (CA) that provides free SSL/TLS certificates for websites and applications. It was founded in 2014 by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), a non-profit organization with a mission to improve internet security and privacy. The project is supported by major technology companies, including Mozilla, Cisco, Google, and many others.

The main goal of Let's Encrypt is to make encrypted connections (HTTPS) more accessible, secure, and easy to deploy by offering free, automated, and open certificates. It aims to make the entire web more secure by encouraging widespread adoption of HTTPS.

Here are some key features and benefits of Let's Encrypt:

. *Free*: Let's Encrypt offers SSL/TLS certificates at no cost, removing the financial barrier for website owners and encouraging them to adopt HTTPS.

. *Automatic*: The process of obtaining and renewing certificates is automated through the ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) protocol. This reduces the effort and time required to manage certificates.

. *Open*: Let's Encrypt is an open CA that provides public documentation and APIs for developers. This openness encourages the development of new tools and clients that make it even easier to use Let's Encrypt.

. *Secure*: Let's Encrypt uses modern security standards and best practices, such as supporting only strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols. It also encourages the adoption of security features like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and OCSP Stapling.

. *Transparent*: Let's Encrypt maintains transparency in its operations by providing public records of all issued and revoked certificates. This transparency helps build trust and allows the community to monitor the CA's activities.

. *Widespread Support*: Let's Encrypt is trusted by most modern browsers and operating systems, making its certificates compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms.

. *Short Lifespan*: Let's Encrypt certificates have a 90-day validity period, which reduces the potential impact of compromised keys and encourages automation of certificate management.

It's important to note that Let's Encrypt only offers Domain Validation (DV) certificates, which verify the domain owner's control over the domain. It does not provide Organization Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV) certificates, which require additional levels of identity verification. If your organization requires an OV or EV certificate, you will need to obtain one from a different Certificate Authority.

Overall, Let's Encrypt has significantly contributed to the widespread adoption of HTTPS on the internet by making it easier and more affordable for website owners to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates. This has led to a more secure and privacy-respecting web for everyone.

== Regulations and compliance

While Let's Encrypt has made it easier for businesses to secure their websites with SSL/TLS certificates, there are some potential risks and considerations to be aware of when using their certificates for business purposes:

. *Domain Validation (DV) only*: Let's Encrypt offers only Domain Validation (DV) certificates, which verify control over the domain but do not provide organization-level validation. For businesses that require a higher level of trust, such as e-commerce websites or sites that handle sensitive user data, an Organization Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV) certificate from another Certificate Authority might be more appropriate.

. *Short certificate lifespan*: Let's Encrypt certificates have a 90-day validity period, which requires frequent renewals. While this promotes better security practices, it also increases the risk of potential downtime if the automated renewal process fails. Businesses should have a monitoring system in place to ensure certificates are renewed promptly and to alert administrators in case of any issues.

. *Compliance requirements*: Some industries or regions have specific regulatory or compliance requirements that may not be met by Let's Encrypt. For example, some organizations may be required to use a specific Certificate Authority or a particular type of SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., OV or EV) to meet compliance requirements. In such cases, businesses should consult their legal or compliance teams to ensure they are using appropriate certificates.

. *Limited certificate types*: Let's Encrypt focuses on providing SSL/TLS certificates for web servers and does not offer other types of certificates, such as code signing certificates, email certificates, or client authentication certificates. If your business requires these types of certificates, you will need to obtain them from another Certificate Authority.

. *Support*: Let's Encrypt is a free service, and as such, it does not provide the same level of dedicated customer support that you might expect from a commercial Certificate Authority. While Let's Encrypt has an active community forum and extensive documentation, businesses with more complex requirements or needing immediate support may find this an important consideration.

Overall, Let's Encrypt is a reliable and widely-accepted Certificate Authority that has greatly contributed to securing the internet. However, businesses should carefully evaluate their specific requirements, compliance obligations, and risk tolerance to determine if Let's Encrypt is the right choice for their SSL/TLS needs. In some cases, a commercial Certificate Authority offering OV or EV certificates and dedicated support might be a more appropriate option.

== Comparing with commercial CAs 

When comparing commercial Certificate Authorities (CAs) with Let's Encrypt, both providing Domain Validation (DV) certificates, there are several differences to consider:

. *Cost*: Let's Encrypt offers DV certificates for free, while commercial CAs typically charge a fee. The fees vary depending on the CA and can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per year.

. *Certificate Lifespan*: Let's Encrypt certificates have a short validity period of 90 days, requiring more frequent renewals. Commercial CAs often provide certificates with longer validity periods, such as one or two years, which may be more convenient for some users.

. *Automation*: Let's Encrypt emphasizes automated certificate issuance and renewal through the ACME protocol. Many commercial CAs also support automation, but the level of automation may vary, and in some cases, manual steps may still be required.

. *Support*: Commercial CAs typically provide dedicated customer support, including phone, email, and live chat support, which can be helpful for businesses with complex requirements or immediate support needs. Let's Encrypt, being a free service, relies on community support and does not offer dedicated customer support channels.

. *Additional Services*: Some commercial CAs offer additional features and services, such as vulnerability scanning, malware monitoring, or website seals, which can provide added value to businesses. Let's Encrypt focuses solely on providing DV certificates and does not offer these additional services.

. *Trust*: While both Let's Encrypt and commercial CAs are trusted by most modern browsers and operating systems, some older devices or platforms may not have Let's Encrypt's root certificate in their trust stores, potentially leading to trust issues. However, this is becoming less of a concern as older devices and platforms are phased out.

. *Wildcard Certificates*: Both Let's Encrypt and commercial CAs offer wildcard certificates, which secure all subdomains under a domain. However, some commercial CAs may provide more flexible options for multi-domain certificates, allowing you to secure multiple domains with a single certificate.

Ultimately, the choice between Let's Encrypt and a commercial CA for DV certificates depends on your specific needs, budget, and requirements. If cost is a primary concern and you're comfortable with the shorter certificate lifespan and community-based support, Let's Encrypt is a viable option. However, if you require dedicated support, additional services, or have specific compliance requirements, a commercial CA might be a better fit.

== Create a certificate

You can use Let's Encrypt to generate SSL/TLS certificates for your corporate website or business applications. Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that provides domain-validated certificates that are trusted by most modern browsers and operating systems.

To create a certificate using Let's Encrypt, you can use the *certbot* tool or an alternative client that supports the ACME protocol. Here's a step-by-step guide using certbot:

. *Install certbot*: Depending on your operating system and web server, you can find installation instructions for certbot on the official website: https://certbot.eff.org/instructions

. *Run certbot*: After installing certbot, run it with the appropriate parameters for your web server and domain. For example, if you are using Apache on Ubuntu, the command would be:
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com
----
+
Replace "example.com" and "www.example.com" with your domain and any subdomains you want to include in the certificate.

. *Complete the domain validation*: certbot will interact with the Let's Encrypt CA and prompt you to complete the domain validation process. This usually involves creating a DNS record or uploading a file to your web server to prove that you control the domain. certbot will provide you with the necessary instructions.

. *Install the certificate*: After the validation process is complete, certbot will automatically install the SSL/TLS certificate on your web server and configure it to use the certificate. The certificate files will be stored in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name/ directory`.

. *Test the certificate*: Verify that your website or application is now using the SSL/TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt by visiting your domain using "https://" in a browser.

. *Set up automatic renewal*: Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. To ensure your certificate remains valid, set up a scheduled task (e.g., cron job) to automatically renew the certificate. Most certbot installations create a renewal script in /etc/cron.d/certbot or /etc/cron.daily/certbot, which takes care of renewing the certificates. You can manually test the renewal process by running:
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
----

By following these steps, you can create and install a Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate for your corporate website or business application. Keep in mind that Let's Encrypt only provides domain-validated (DV) certificates, which verify that you control the domain. If your business requires a higher level of validation, such as organization validation (OV) or extended validation (EV), you will need to obtain a certificate from a different Certificate Authority that offers these types of certificates.
