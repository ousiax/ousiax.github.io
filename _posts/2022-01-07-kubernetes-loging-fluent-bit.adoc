== Kubernetes Logging Architecture

Application logs can help you understand what is happening inside your application. The logs are particularly useful for debugging problems and monitoring cluster activity. Most modern applications have some kind of logging mechanism. Likewise, container engines are designed to support logging. The easiest and most adopted logging method for containerized applications is writing to *standard output* and *standard error* streams.

However, the native functionality provided by a container engine or runtime is usually not enough for a complete logging solution. For example, you may want access your application's logs if a container crashes; a pod gets evicted; or a node dies. In a cluster, logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. This concept is called *cluster-level logging*.

Cluster-level logging architectures require a separate backend to store, analyze, and query logs. Kubernetes does not provide a native storage solution for log data. Instead, there are many logging solutions that integrate with Kubernetes.

=== Logging at the Node Level

image::https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/59b1aae2adcfe4f06270b99a2789012ed64bec1f/4d0ad/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-node-level.png[,55%,55%]

A *container engine* handles and redirects any output generated to a containerized application's `stdout` and `stderr` streams. For example, the Docker container engine redirects those two streams to a https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview[logging driver], which is configured in Kubernetes to write to a file in JSON format.

By default, if a container restarts, the kubelet keeps one terminated container with its logs. If a pod is evicted from the node, all corresponding containers are also evicted, along with their logs.

An important consideration in node-level logging is implementing *log rotation*, so that logs don't consume all available storage on the node. Kubernetes is not responsible for rotating logs, but rather a deployment tool should set up a solution to address that.

When using a *CRI container runtime*, the kubelet is responsible for rotating the logs and managing the logging directory structure. The kubelet sends this information to the CRI container runtime and the runtime writes the container logs to the given location. The two kubelet parameters `containerLogMaxSize` and `containerLogMaxFiles` in kubelet config file can be used to configure the maximum size for each log file and the maximum number of files allowed for each container respectively.

When you run `kubectl logs`, the kubelet on the node handles the request and reads directly from the log file. The kubelet returns the content of the log file.

==== System component logs

There are two types of system components: those that run in a container and those that do not run in a container. For example:

* The Kubernetes scheduler and kube-proxy run in a container.
* The kubelet and container runtime do not run in containers.

On machines with systemd, the kubelet and container runtime write to *journald*. If systemd is not present, the kubelet and container runtime write to `.log` files in the `/var/log` directory. System components inside containers always write to the `/var/log` directory, bypassing the default logging mechanism.

=== Cluster-level logging architectures

While Kubernetes does not provide a native solution for cluster-level logging, there are several common approaches you can consider. Here are some options:

* Use a node-level logging agent that runs on every node.

* Include a dedicated sidecar container for logging in an application pod.

* Push logs directly to a backend from within an application.

=== CRI: Log Management for Container Stdout/Stderr Streams

* Logging in kubernetes with docker
+
Docker supports various logging drivers (e.g., syslog, journal, and json-file), and allows users to configure the driver by passing flags to the docker daemon at startup.
+
Kubernetes defaults to the "json-file" logging driver, in which docker writes the stdout/stderr streams to a file in the json format as shown below.
+
[source,json]
----
{"log": "The actual log line", "stream": "stderr", "time": "2016-10-05T00:00:30.082640485Z"}
----
+
In a production cluster, logs are usually collected, aggregated, and shipped to a remote store where advanced analysis/search/archiving functions are supported. In kubernetes, the default cluster-addons includes a per-node log collection daemon, *fluentd*. To facilitate the log collection, kubelet creates symbolic links to all the docker containers logs under `/var/log/containers` with pod and container metadata embedded in the filename.
+
[source,text]
----
/var/log/containers/<pod_name>_<pod_namespace>_<container_name>-<container_id>.log
----
+
The fluentd daemon watches the `/var/log/containers/` directory and extract the metadata associated with the log from the path. 
+
Use `crictl` to determine the log path of containers:
+
[source,console]

* Logging in kubernetes with CRI-compliant Runtimes
+
Kubelet will be configured with a root directory (e.g., `/var/log/pods` or `/var/lib/kubelet/logs/`) to store all container logs. Below is an example of a path to the log of a container in a pod.
+
[source,console]
----
/var/log/pods/<podUID>/<containerName>_<instance#>.log
----
+
In CRI, this is implemented by setting the pod-level log directory when creating the pod sandbox, and passing the relative container log path when creating a container.
+
[source,console]
----
PodSandboxConfig.LogDirectory: /var/log/pods/<podUID>/
ContainerConfig.LogPath: <containerName>_<instance#>.log
----
+
The runtime should decorate each log entry with a RFC 3339Nano *timestamp* prefix, the *stream* type (i.e., "stdout" or "stderr"), the *tags* of the log entry, the log *content* that ends with a newline.
+
The `tags` fields can support multiple tags, delimited by :. Currently, only one tag is defined in CRI to support multi-line log entries: partial or full. Partial (P) is used when a log entry is split into multiple lines by the runtime, and the entry has not ended yet. Full (F) indicates that the log entry is completed -- it is either a single-line entry, or this is the last line of the multiple-line entry.
+
For example,
+
[source,console]
----
2016-10-06T00:17:09.669794202Z stdout F The content of the log entry 1
2016-10-06T00:17:09.669794202Z stdout P First line of log entry 2
2016-10-06T00:17:09.669794202Z stdout P Second line of the log entry 2
2016-10-06T00:17:10.113242941Z stderr F Last line of the log entry 2
----
+
Use `crictl` to determine the log path of containers:

{fluentbit-io}[*Fluent Bit*] is a Fast and Lightweight Logs and Metrics Processor and Forwarder for Linux, OSX, Windows and BSD family operating systems. It has been made with a strong focus on performance to allow the collection of events from different sources without complexity.

{fluentbit-io}[Fluent Bit] is a {cncf-io}[*CNCF*] sub-project under the umbrella of {fluentd-org}[Fluentd], it's licensed under the terms of the {apache-license-2-0}[Apache License v2.0]. The project was originally created by {treasuredata-com}[Treasure Data] and is currently a vendor neutral and community driven project.

=== Fluentd & Fluent Bit

Logging and data processing in general can be complex, and at scale a bit more, that's why  was born. *Fluentd* has become more than a simple tool, it has grown into a fullscale ecosystem that contains SDKs for different languages and sub-projects like *Fluent Bit*.

Both projects share a lot of similarities,  Fluent Bit is fully designed and built on top of the best ideas of Fluentd architecture and general design. Choosing which one to use depends on the end-user needs.

The following table describes a comparison in different areas of the projects:

Both Fluentd and Fluent Bit can work as Aggregators or Forwarders, they both can complement each other or use them as standalone solutions.

=== Key Concepts

* *Event or Record*
+
Every incoming piece of data that belongs to a log or a metric that is retrieved by Fluent Bit is considered an *Event* or a *Record*.
+
As an example consider the following content of a Syslog file:
+
[source,log]
----
Jan 18 12:52:16 flb systemd[2222]: Starting GNOME Terminal Server
Jan 18 12:52:16 flb dbus-daemon[2243]: [session uid=1000 pid=2243] Successfully activated service 'org.gnome.Terminal'
Jan 18 12:52:16 flb systemd[2222]: Started GNOME Terminal Server.
Jan 18 12:52:16 flb gsd-media-keys[2640]: # watch_fast: "/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/" (establishing: 0, active: 0)
----
+
It contains four lines and all of them represents four independent Events.
+
Internally, an Event always has two components (in an array form):
+
[source,log]
----
[TIMESTAMP, MESSAGE]
----

* *Filtering*
+
In some cases it is required to perform modifications on the Events content, the process to alter, enrich or drop Events is called *Filtering*.
+
There are many use cases when Filtering is required like:
+
--
** Append specific information to the Event like an IP address or metadata.
** Select a specific piece of the Event content.
** Drop Events that matches certain pattern.
--

* *Tag*
+
Every Event that gets into Fluent Bit gets assigned a *Tag*. This tag is an internal string that is used in a later stage by the Router to decide which Filter or Output phase it must go through.
+
Most of the tags are assigned manually in the configuration. If a tag is not specified, Fluent Bit will assign the name of the Input plugin instance from where that Event was generated from.

* *Timestamp*
+
The *Timestamp* represents the time when an Event was created. Every Event contains a Timestamp associated. The Timestamp is a numeric fractional integer in the format:
+
[source,log]
SECONDS.NANOSECONDS
+
--
** SECONDS
+
It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch.
+
** NANOSECONDS
+
Fractional second or one thousand-millionth of a second.
--

* *Match*
+
Fluent Bit allows to deliver your collected and processed Events to one or multiple destinations, this is done through a routing phase. A *Match* represent a simple rule to select Events where its Tags matches a defined rule.

* *Structured Messages*
+
Source events can have or not have a structure. A structure defines a set of *keys* and *values* inside the Event message. As an example consider the following two messages:
+
--
** No structured message
+
[source,log]
"Project Fluent Bit created on 1398289291"

** Structured Message
+
[source,json]
{"project": "Fluent Bit", "created": 1398289291}
--
+
At a low level both are just an array of bytes, but the Structured message defines keys and values, having a structure helps to implement faster operations on data modifications.

=== Data Pipeline

:input-plugins: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs
:parsers: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers
:filters: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters
:buffering-and-storage: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/buffering-and-storage
:outputs: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs

* **Input**
+
Fluent Bit provides different {input-plugins}[*Input Plugins*] to gather information from different sources, some of them just collect data from log files while others can gather metrics information from the operating system. There are many plugins for different needs.
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-b7fcf1991f8c5c597508c343f00183fd748ace41%2Flogging_pipeline_input%20(1)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
When an input plugin is loaded, an internal instance is created. Every instance has its own and independent configuration. Configuration keys are often called *properties*.

* *Parser*
+
Dealing with raw strings or unstructured messages is a constant pain; having a structure is highly desired. Ideally we want to set a structure to the incoming data by the Input Plugins as soon as they are collected:
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-621897340d1948b951b35ee1562bc92ae5bf1c07%2Flogging_pipeline_parser%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(3)%20(3)%20(3)%20(3)%20(3).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
The {parsers}[Parser] allows you to convert from unstructured to structured data. As a demonstrative example consider the following Apache (HTTP Server) log entry:
+
[source,log]
----
192.168.2.20 - - [28/Jul/2006:10:27:10 -0300] "GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0" 200 3395
----
+
The above log line is a raw string without format, ideally we would like to give it a structure that can be processed later easily. If the proper configuration is used, the log entry could be converted to:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "host":    "192.168.2.20",
  "user":    "-",
  "method":  "GET",
  "path":    "/cgi-bin/try/",
  "code":    "200",
  "size":    "3395",
  "referer": "",
  "agent":   ""
}
----

* *Filter*
+
In production environments we want to have full control of the data we are collecting, {filters}[filtering] is an important feature that allows us to *alter* the data before delivering it to some destination.
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-d17cb9c2db05ee937fe51b034b41e6ccd8505e1e%2Flogging_pipeline_filter%20(1)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
Filtering is implemented through plugins, so each filter available could be used to match, exclude or enrich your logs with some specific metadata.

* *Buffer*
+
The {buffering-and-storage}[buffer] phase in the pipeline aims to provide a unified and persistent mechanism to store your data, either using the primary in-memory model or using the filesystem based mode.
+
The buffer phase already contains the data in an *immutable state*, meaning, no other filter can be applied.
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ba80a23b4f579320e29e8e7faf0de64d0f74f894%2Flogging_pipeline_buffer%20(1)%20(1)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
Fluent Bit offers a buffering mechanism in the file system that acts as a *backup* system to avoid data loss in case of system failures.

* *Router*
+
Routing is a core feature that allows to *route* your data through Filters and finally to one or multiple destinations. The router relies on the concept of Tags and Matching rules.
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-069ff2a17abfe52dbd036cca95023d6bcc9878a3%2Flogging_pipeline_routing%20(1)%20(1)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(2)%20(1).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
When the data is generated by the input plugins, it comes with a *Tag* (most of the time the Tag is configured manually), the Tag is a human-readable indicator that helps to identify the data source.
+
In order to define *where* the data should be routed, a *Match* rule must be specified in the output configuration.
+
Consider the following configuration example that aims to deliver CPU metrics to an Elasticsearch database and Memory metrics to the standard output interface:
+
[source,conf]
----
[INPUT]
    Name cpu
    Tag  my_cpu

[INPUT]
    Name mem
    Tag  my_mem

[OUTPUT]
    Name   es
    Match  my_cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name   stdout
    Match  my_mem
----
+
Routing works automatically reading the Input Tags and the Output Match rules. If some data has a Tag that doesn't match upon routing time, the data is deleted.
+
Routing is flexible enough to support *wildcard* in the Match pattern. The below example defines a common destination for both sources of data:
+
[source,conf]
----
[INPUT]
    Name cpu
    Tag  my_cpu

[INPUT]
    Name mem
    Tag  my_mem

[OUTPUT]
    Name   stdout
    Match  my_*
----
+
The match rule is set to `my_*` which means it will match any Tag that starts with `my_`.

* *Output*
+
The output interface allows us to define destinations for the data. Common destinations are remote services, local file system or standard interface with others. {outputs}[Outputs] are implemented as plugins and there are many available.
+
image::https://docs.fluentbit.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl-887967055%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-5d66005fe346d267ddbc3f5e00a24c07ceca73ee%2Flogging_pipeline_output%20(1).png?alt=media[,70%,70%]
+
When an output plugin is loaded, an internal instance is created. Every instance has its own independent configuration. Configuration keys are often called properties.

=== Configuring Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit might optionally use a configuration file to define how the service will behave.

A simple example of a configuration file is as follows:

[source,text]
----
[SERVICE]
    # This is a commented line
    Daemon    off
    log_level debug
----

The configuration schema is defined by three concepts:

* Sections
+
A *section* is defined by a name or title inside brackets. Looking at the example above, a Service section has been set using `[SERVICE]` definition. Section rules:
+
** All section content must be indented (4 spaces ideally).
** Multiple sections can exist on the same file.
** A section is expected to have comments and entries, it cannot be empty.
** Any commented line under a section, must be indented too.

* Entries: Key/Value
+
A section may contain *Entries*, an entry is defined by a line of text that contains a *Key* and a *Value*, using the above example, the `[SERVICE]` section contains two entries, one is the key `Daemon` with value `off` and the other is the key `Log_Level` with the value `debug`. Entries rules:
+
** An entry is defined by a key and a value.
** A key must be indented.
** A key must contain a value which ends in the breakline.
** Multiple keys with the same name can exist.
+
Also commented lines are set prefixing the # character, those lines are not processed but they must be indented too.

* Indented Configuration Mode
+
Fluent Bit configuration files are based in a strict *Indented Mode*, that means that each configuration file must follow the same pattern of alignment from left to right when writing text. By default an indentation level of four spaces from left to right is suggested.

One of the ways to configure Fluent Bit is using a main configuration file. The main configuration file supports four types of sections: *Service*, *Input*, *Filter*, *Output*. In addition, it's also possible to split the main configuration file in multiple files using the feature to include external files: Include File.

The following configuration file example demonstrates how to collect CPU metrics and flush the results every five seconds to the standard output:

[source,text]
----
[SERVICE]
    Flush     5
    Daemon    off
    Log_Level debug

[INPUT]
    Name  cpu
    Tag   my_cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name  stdout
    Match my*cpu
----

To avoid complicated long configuration files is better to split specific parts in different files and call them (include) from one main file.

Starting from Fluent Bit 0.12 the new configuration command @INCLUDE has been added and can be used in the following way:

[source,text]
----
@INCLUDE somefile.conf
----

The configuration reader will try to open the path somefile.conf, if not found, it will assume it's a relative path based on the path of the base configuration file.

The *@INCLUDE* command only works at top-left level of the configuration line, it cannot be used inside sections.

Wildcard character (`*`) is supported to include multiple files, e.g:

[source,text]
----
@INCLUDE input_*.conf
----

Fluent Bit supports the usage of *environment variables* in any value associated to a key when using a configuration file.

The variables are case sensitive and can be used in the following format:

[source,text]
----
${MY_VARIABLE}
----

When Fluent Bit starts, the configuration reader will detect any request for `${MY_VARIABLE}` and will try to resolve its value.

=== Docker

Fluent Bit container images are available on Docker Hub ready for production usage. Current available images can be deployed in multiple architectures.

The following (useless) test which makes Fluent Bit measure CPU usage by the container:

[source,console]
----
$ docker run -ti fluent/fluent-bit:1.8 /fluent-bit/bin/fluent-bit -i cpu -o stdout -f 1
----

That command will let Fluent Bit measure CPU usage every second and flush the results to the standard output:

[source,console]

=== Kubernetes

Fluent Bit is a lightweight and extensible *Log Processor* that comes with full support for Kubernetes:

* Process Kubernetes containers logs from the file system or Systemd/Journald.
* Enrich logs with Kubernetes Metadata.
* Centralize your logs in third party storage services like Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, HTTP, etc.

Kubernetes manages a cluster of nodes, so our log agent tool will need to run on every node to collect logs from every POD, hence Fluent Bit is deployed as a DaemonSet (a POD that runs on every node of the cluster).

When Fluent Bit runs, it will read, parse and filter the logs of every POD and will enrich each entry with the following information (metadata):

* Pod Name
* Pod ID
* Container Name
* Container ID
* Labels
* Annotations

To obtain this information, a built-in filter plugin called {filters-kubernetes}[*kubernetes*] talks to the Kubernetes API Server to retrieve relevant information such as the pod_id, labels and annotations, other fields such as pod_name, container_id and container_name are retrieved locally from the log file names. All of this is handled automatically, no intervention is required from a configuration aspect.

Kubernetes Filter depends on either {inputs-tail}[Tail] and {inputs-systemd}[Systemd] input plugins to process and enrich records with Kubernetes metadata. Here we will explain the workflow of Tail and how it configuration is correlated with Kubernetes filter. Consider the following configuration example (just for demo purposes, not production):

[source,text]
----
[INPUT]
    Name    tail
    Tag     kube.*
    Path    /var/log/containers/*.log
    Parser  docker

[FILTER]
    Name             kubernetes
    Match            kube.*
    Kube_URL         https://kubernetes.default.svc:443
    Kube_CA_File     /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    Kube_Token_File  /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    Kube_Tag_Prefix  kube.var.log.containers.
    Merge_Log        On
    Merge_Log_Key    log_processed
----

* Systemd
+
The {inputs-systemd}[*systemd*] input plugin allows to collect log messages from the *Journald* daemon on Linux environments.
+
[source,text]
----
[INPUT]
    Name            systemd
    Tag             host.*
    Systemd_Filter  _SYSTEMD_UNIT=docker.service
----

* Tail
+
The {inputs-tail}[*tail*] input plugin allows to monitor one or several text files. It has a similar behavior like `tail -f` shell command.
+
The plugin reads every matched file in the *Path* pattern and for every new line found, it generates a new record. Optionally a database file can be used so the plugin can have a history of tracked files and a state of offsets, this is very useful to resume a state if the service is restarted.
+
If you are running Fluent Bit to process logs coming from containers like Docker or CRI, you can use the new {multiline-parsing}[built-in modes] for such purposes. This will help to reassembly *multiline messages* originally split by Docker or CRI:
+
[source,text]
----
[INPUT]
    name              tail
    path              /var/log/containers/*.log
    # exclude_path      /var/log/containers/*_logging_*.log,/var/log/containers/*_default*.log
    multiline.parser  docker, cri
----
+
The two options separated by a comma means multi-format: try `docker` and `cri` multiline formats.
